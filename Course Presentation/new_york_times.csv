Whirring Into Action in Ukraine’s Skies,"Sat, 04 Mar 2023 16:55:04 +0000","Against the odds, Ukraine’s helicopter brigades are not only still operational, but are an inspirational component of its war effort.",Carlotta Gall and Daniel Berehulak,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/04/world/europe/ukraine-helicopters-russia.html,"On a snowbound field, three Soviet-era helicopters were being readied for battle. Pilots and crew checked the flight plan for their next target, while technicians loaded slim gray rockets into launcher pods and stacked flares into racks behind the exhaust.

One year into the war, against all the odds, Ukraine’s helicopter brigades are still operational. Every day of the week, multiple times a day, they go into battle against enemy forces, launching rocket attacks along the front lines in support of ground troops and occasionally slipping under Russian air defenses to fly covert missions into enemy territory.

Far from being knocked out in the first days of the invasion, Ukraine’s helicopters and jets have kept flying, remaining an inspiring and useful element of the war effort.

In a rare opportunity, the 18th Sikorsky Brigade, the foremost of Ukraine’s four helicopter brigades, gave reporters access to a combat unit for two days recently. Officers and pilots described how the Ukrainian brigades moved their aircraft at the onset of the war to evade Russian strikes, and how they adapted their tactics to fighting a much more powerful and better equipped adversary."
"They Shared Erotic Images in a Group Chat. The Fine: $17,000.","Sat, 04 Mar 2023 18:55:16 +0000",A couple in Singapore created a Telegram account where they posted risqué content for subscribers.

She looks around to make sure no one can see her. Then she pulls down her top, revealing a breast to her partner, who is filming her.

The woman, Nguyen Thi Anh Thy, and her husband, Jeffrey Chue, say no one saw them make the video in May 2020. A day later, Mr. Chue uploaded it to a private channel he had created on the messaging app Telegram mostly for people who participate in group sex and partner swapping.

Membership in the channel grew, and the video quickly found its way beyond the members — to the internet.

Two years later, a court in Singapore fined the couple $17,000, saying the video as well as other photos of Ms. Nguyen in various states of undress violated the country’s laws against nudity and obscenity. The couple was also convicted of providing and abetting false information."
"In West Bank, New Armed Groups Emerge, and Dormant Ones Stir","Sat, 04 Mar 2023 15:33:25 +0000","The small but influential Lions’ Den network has attracted young Palestinians disappointed by their leaders and angry at Israeli violence. Veteran fighters are restless, too.",Patrick Kingsley and Hiba Yazbek,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/04/world/middleeast/west-bank-lions-den.html,"After a violent uprising by Palestinians against Israel subsided nearly two decades ago, Abu Abdallah, then a leader of a Palestinian militia, stashed away his assault rifle and later became a civil servant in the West Bank city of Nablus.

When Israeli troops raided Nablus late last month, Abu Abdallah, now 42, lent that rifle to a group of Palestinian gunmen 20 years younger who were locked in a four-hour gun battle with the soldiers in the Palestinian city. That made him a party to the conflict for the first time in years — one of several former fighters who returned to the fray that day, he said.

“We have this feeling that we need to do our duty,” said Abu Abdallah, who asked to be identified by his nom de guerre in order to avoid legal repercussions.

For years, the Palestinian Authority, the semiautonomous body that administers cities in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, like Nablus, worked with Israel to keep Palestinian militias in relative check. The authority had hoped that building enough trust with Israeli leaders would persuade them to allow the formation of a Palestinian state."
A Massacre That Rippled Through Generations in Thailand,"Sat, 04 Mar 2023 13:35:31 +0000","For the parents and the grandparents of the children who were killed as they slept at a rural day care, coming to terms with the tragedy has been an impossible task.",Ryn Jirenuwat and Sui-Lee Wee,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/04/world/asia/thailand-daycare-massacre.html,"When a former police officer in rural Thailand shot and stabbed more than two dozen children as they napped in their preschool in October, the episode became the worst mass shooting by a lone attacker in Thailand’s history.

After the attack — which killed 36 people, 24 of them children — the Thai authorities ordered law enforcement agencies to tighten gun ownership rules in Thailand, which has more guns than anywhere else in Southeast Asia.

But little else has changed. And the families continue to grieve.

Many of the children were cared for by their grandparents as their parents worked in faraway cities. “These kinds of families — we call them ‘skipped-generation families,’” said Patcharin Lapanun, an assistant professor at Thailand’s Khon Kaen University. “In these kinds of households, there are the grandchildren and grandparents living together, but their parents leave home.”

That distance amplified the pain that has rippled across generations where the attack occurred, in Uthai Sawan."
"The Woman Shaking Up Italian Politics (No, Not the New Prime Minister)","Sat, 04 Mar 2023 08:00:11 +0000","Daughter of Italian and Jewish American parents, Elly Schlein wants to remake the center-left opposition to Giorgia Meloni, if only her party can survive it.",Jason Horowitz,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/04/world/europe/elly-schlein-italy.html,"ROME — Growing up in Switzerland, Elly Schlein felt a little lost.

“I was the black sheep. Because my brother and sister seemed to be more sure of what they would do,” the politician recalled. She watched Italian neorealist cinema and American comedies, played Philip Glass on the piano, pet her dwarf bunny named after Freddie Mercury, listened to the Cranberries and ultimately got involved in her school’s politics. “It took a lot more time for me to find my way,” she said.

Last weekend, Ms. Schlein, 37, found her way into the center of the debate about the future of the European left when she stunned the liberal establishment and reordered Italy’s political landscape by winning a primary election to become the first woman to lead the country’s center-left Democratic Party. She is promising, she said in her new office headquarters on Wednesday, to “change deeply” a party in the midst of an identity crisis.

It is hard to embody change in Italy more than Ms. Schlein.

A woman in a relationship with a woman, she is the daughter of a Jewish American father; granddaughter of an Italian antifascist partisan; proud native of Lugano, Switzerland; former volunteer for Barack Obama; collaborator on an award-winning documentary about Albanian refugees; fan of “Naked Gun” movies; shredder of Green Day chords on her electric guitar; and fervent progressive eager to make common international cause with “A.O.C.,” Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York."
"After Greek Train Crash, Station Manager Faces Court","Sat, 04 Mar 2023 15:42:34 +0000","After a deadly train crash, rail workers said that a key signal light was always stuck on red, and that station managers only warned one another of oncoming trains via walkie-talkie.",Emma Bubola,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/04/world/europe/greek-crash-station-manager-court.html,"“I’d cross myself every time for a crash not to happen,” said Theodor Leventis, a train safety supervisor of 20 years. He attended a vigil for the train’s victims in front of Larissa’s train station on Friday. “I was sure it would happen,” he added.

Mr. Leventis, 65, retired two years ago after working on the same route where the crash had occurred. “They can’t say a man is responsible,” he said. “The only one responsible is the government.”

The Greek government was supposed to have installed an automated safety system nearly three years ago, but it received extensions amid a contentious contracting process. That system is intended to sound alarms and automatically stop locomotives in dangerous situations.

In the days after the crash, the Greek government has not explained why that system was so behind schedule. Neither have officials with the European Union, which spent hundreds of millions of euros over the past decade to improve a rail system that, by multiple measures, is the deadliest in Europe.

Railway unions have long warned of looming disaster. Workers said their fears started to mount after the financial crisis that devastated Greece’s economy in 2010. Railway staffing was sharply cut and unions have said for years that their members were overworked and assigned to important stations without proper training experience.

Giorgos Apostoleris, a former station master, recalled being transferred a few years ago to Larissa on an hour’s notice. He worried then about who would be held responsible if he made a mistake. Tragedy, he said on Friday, was all but inevitable. “It even took too long for an accident to happen,” he said in an interview."
Fight for Ukrainian City of Bakhmut Becomes a Battle Over Roads,"Sat, 04 Mar 2023 17:41:55 +0000",Ukraine’s military said that Russia was inching ahead in its efforts to encircle the city but that it had beaten back several attacks on supply routes.,Andrew E.

But the Ukrainian military acknowledged that soldiers inside the city were now encircled on three sides by a combined force of the Russian Army and the Wagner private military company, which includes fighters recruited from prisons.

On Friday, the company’s owner, Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, taunted President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine in a video, saying that only one road remained open to the west of Bakhmut, a city in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian commanders say that a counterattack this past week pushed Russian forces away from at least one of the embattled roads into the city, for the moment easing resupply for troops inside."

Hours later, three were arrested in connection with the case.

The motive for the killing, the latest in a series of deadly attacks on political leaders, was not immediately clear. Initial police reports said that the governor, Roel Degamo, had been at home in the town of Pamplona, in the province of Negros Oriental, when the attack took place.

At least five other people present were also killed. They were described as citizens who had been meeting with Mr. Degamo to seek aid from the governor’s welfare program.

President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., calling for a speedy investigation, vowed that the killers would be caught."

That helps explain why Ms. Raza, a mother of one, was traveling to Italy from Turkey last month on a boat with other economic migrants from Central Asia. Ms. Raza, 29, was one of at least 63 people who died when rough seas dashed the boat against rocks about a hundred yards from the Italian shore — agonizingly close to the land where she had hoped to start a new life.

Ms. Raza had left her 3-year-old son, who is partly paralyzed, with her ex-husband in Pakistan before starting her dangerous journey. But her family and friends say her plan was to settle the boy eventually in Italy, where she hoped he would receive better medical treatment.

“She was deeply concerned about his health and wanted him to have a normal life,” Saba Khanum, one of her longtime soccer and field hockey teammates, said in an interview."
Diplomat Who Faced Brexit Freeze in U.K. Now Sees a ‘New Beginning’,"Sat, 04 Mar 2023 15:19:50 +0000","As the European Union’s first ambassador in London, João Vale de Almeida had to fight even for official recognition.

Under either of the ousted prime ministers, Mr. Vale de Almeida indicated, prospects were dim for resolving one of the most serious conflicts contributing to rocky post-Brexit relations between Britain and the European Union: the trade status of Northern Ireland.

But the relationship has shifted significantly with the rise of a new prime minister, Rishi Sunak, Mr. Vale de Almeida said, culminating on Monday when Mr. Sunak and Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the E.U.’s executive arm, the European Commission, struck a deal to resolve their Northern Ireland dispute.

That breakthrough, Mr. Vale de Almeida said, opened a path to greater cooperation not only between Brussels and London, but also between Europe and the United States, in confronting common challenges like Russian aggression and rising tension with China, where Western cooperation is essential."
What to Expect at China’s National People’s Congress as Xi Tightens Grip,"Sat, 04 Mar 2023 16:33:14 +0000","When its top legislature meets, Beijing will lay out a vision for reviving economic growth and strengthening the Communist Party’s grip after a chaotic reopening.",Chang Che,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/04/world/asia/china-congress-xi-jinping.html,"China’s leaders are set to use a gathering of the top legislature starting Sunday to outline plans to restore public confidence and bolster economic growth after a year of uncertainty, disruption and discontent around the government’s Covid restrictions.

The annual session of the largely ceremonial National People’s Congress in Beijing is aimed at conveying the ruling Communist Party’s confidence and inspiring national unity. For the country’s top leader, Xi Jinping, this year’s event will also be key to reinforcing his authority after his signature “zero Covid” policy, now abandoned, drew widespread protests in November and worsened an economic slowdown.

The leadership will lay out its agenda for addressing challenges such as mounting local government debt, unemployment, a housing slump, weak exports and a shrinking population. Delegates are expected to rubber-stamp decisions made in advance, behind closed doors, by leaders of the party who hold ultimate authority.

At the end of the gathering, which runs for nine days, Mr. Xi is all but assured to be appointed to another five-year term as president after securing a groundbreaking third term as party leader in October. He is also expected to appoint his loyalists and allies to key government positions."
They Sneaked Into a Derelict Arms Plant: Instagrammers or Spies?,"Fri, 03 Mar 2023 18:08:50 +0000","Three people, including two Russians, arrested on charges of entering an abandoned rifle factory have puzzled Albanian authorities at a time when suspicions about Moscow have been mounting.",Andrew Higgins,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/03/world/europe/albania-russia-ukraine.html,"Spiro Lasi, a construction worker whose house looks out over the Gramsh factory, said he was stunned that the trespassers were being held on suspicion of spying. “It makes no sense to me at all,” he said, noting that the factory had stopped work decades ago and, though still guarded by the Albanian military, holds nothing but ruins.

Aldi Kozaria, an Albanian journalist who broke the story of the arrests, said that he was initially skeptical, too, but that he now thinks the three were definitely up to no good. “In the beginning I thought it was all a joke, but if you connect dots the case starts to makes sense,” he said.

One important dot, he says, is the fact that shortly after the arrests, Moscow sent an urgent request to Albania for the extradition of one of the two detained Russians, Svetlana Timofeyeva, 33, a prominent urbex photographer with more than 250,000 followers on Instagram, where she uses the name Lana Sator.

The extradition request claimed that Ms. Timofeyeva was wanted in Russia in connection with a 2018 criminal case involving illegal entry into an underground military site in Chekhov, a town south of Moscow that housed a Cold War nuclear command center.

The Albanian prosecutor leading the investigation, Kreshnik Ajazi, says he thinks it fishy that Moscow moved so quickly to dust off an old case to justify a demand that Ms. Timofeyeva be sent back to Russia. Extradition, he said, “is one of the ways they rescue people.”

But Ms. Timofeyeva, according to her lawyer, Fatmir Lushi, has no desire to go back to Russia and is fighting extradition because she “left a clear record on social media against Putin and the war in Ukraine.” Mr. Lushi discounted the possibility that Russia’s request was a ruse to save an agent. On the contrary, he said, Ms. Timofeyeva faced punishment if sent to Russia and would be treated “very inhumanely.”"
Nobel Prize Is No Defense Against Jail for Ales Bialiatski in Belarus,"Sat, 04 Mar 2023 08:12:24 +0000","Ales Bialiatski, last year’s Nobel Peace Prize laureate, has been sentenced by Belarus to 10 years in prison, on charges that rights advocates have dismissed as politically motivated.",Andrew Higgins,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/03/world/europe/ales-bialiatski-belarus-nobel-peace-prize.html,"Unsettled by the war in neighboring Ukraine and the increasing militancy of some opposition groups, Belarus on Friday sentenced Ales Bialiatski — a veteran human rights activist who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in October — to 10 years in prison, according to Viasna, the group that he helped found.

Mr. Bialiatski, 60, has been a pillar of the human rights movement in Eastern Europe since the late 1980s, when Belarus was part of the Soviet Union. He continued in that role after President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, the country’s veteran strongman leader, took power in 1994, revived Soviet-era repression and turned his nation into a Russian satellite state.

Mr. Lukashenko, who allowed Belarus to serve as a staging ground for Russia’s abortive attack on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, last February, has been under intense pressure from Moscow in recent months to take a more direct role in the war. He has also been unnerved by militant opposition activists in exile, some of whom have joined Ukrainian forces fighting to repel Russia and have threatened to take the fight into Belarus.

An exiled opposition group last week claimed responsibility for an attack on a Russian surveillance aircraft based at a Belarusian military airfield east of Minsk, the capital. Most experts believe the attack was carried out by Ukraine but the incident caused alarm in the Belarusian leadership over potential threats to its tight grip on power."
Rules to Curb Illicit Dollar Flows Create Unintended Hardships for Some Iraqis,"Sat, 04 Mar 2023 05:40:45 +0000",The regulations were meant to prevent dollar transfers to corrupt actors. But they have ended up harming ordinary Iraqis who need U.S. currency for legitimate purposes.,Alissa J. Rubin,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/03/world/middleeast/iraq-currency-sanctions-economy.html,"Separately, a sum in cash is sent to the Iraqi central bank, intended for currency exchanges and banks to distribute largely to Iraqis traveling abroad.

Until the new rules were put in place, there had been little in the way of electronic footprints to help U.S. officials trace whether some of the transfers were ending up in the hands of criminal actors.

For example, an Iraqi party might request that a wire in dollars be sent to a bank in another country, such as the United Arab Emirates, in payment for goods that are being imported into Iraq. But, the account in the U.A.E. could also be used to move dollars outside Iraq to launder money or supply a party under sanctions. So more information was needed to be sure that such transactions are legitimate.

The concerns about dollars ending up in the wrong hands date back to soon after the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. At that time, American authorities were concerned primarily about cash transfers but the U.S. Treasury later turned its attention increasingly to wire transfers.

The Treasury wanted to ensure that dollars sent by wire were not being sent in violation of U.S. law to fronts or agents for parties under sanctions or criminal entities. In congressional testimony in 2016, for example, a top Treasury official noted three groups targeted by sanctions that were known to be active in Iraq: Al Qaeda, the Islamic State and the Iran-backed Lebanese militia Hezbollah.

With the Islamic State’s takeover of northern Iraq in 2014, it seized a branch of Iraq’s central bank and those concerns became more urgent. The situation underscored the need for more transparency in the dollar wire transfers."
"Old Skills, New Rewards","Sat, 04 Mar 2023 11:24:21 +0000","There are so many good reasons to return to hobbies and activities that gave us joy when we were younger, as these reader stories show.",Melissa Kirsch,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/04/briefing/trying-activities-again.html,"Last week I wrote about my delight over skiing for the first time in 20 years. Many readers then told me about the long-dormant skills and forsaken hobbies that they’ve rediscovered. I was struck by the confidence that comes from returning to horseback riding or ice skating or skateboarding again as an adult. Older and wiser, readers were able to dispense with their youthful hangups, to find meaning in what were once just extracurricular activities. Here are some of their stories that have stayed with me:

Kurt Neubert of San Mateo, Calif., is a Juilliard-trained former musician. He recently picked up the violin after a 28-year break. “Slowly, I started playing excerpts from pieces I used to enjoy but quickly realized that while the neuromuscular memory was there, my left hand had lost most of the agility from its former life. I decided not to give up but to embrace it as a beginner again!” he wrote, adding, “This experience has been a metaphor for this chapter of my life — to let go, step aside and let it unfold organically.”

When the daughters of Eric Ahern of Somerville, Mass., play in the park, he’s rediscovering skateboarding. “I’d rather while away some time skating and doing basic tricks than sitting on a bench,” he wrote. “I get plenty of weird looks from the other parents, but I own it. Skateboarding is a sport for misfits, and I still feel like an outsider at 45, so I embrace it.”

Morgan McEwen of Kennebunkport, Maine, took a 12-year hiatus from snowboarding. Now she’s back at it at 42. “I think it helps to have an outdoor hobby to make winter something other than a season you just try to get through,” she wrote.

Megan Brenenstuhl from Saratoga Springs, N.Y., has returned to tennis. “It is both humbling (realizing the changes in my body over the 20 years) and exhilarating (so much has come back to me),” she wrote. “If there was something you once loved doing, give it a shot because the 20-years-ago you is still in there and it’s fun to find them!”"
"Canada Knows China Tried to Meddle in Its Elections, but What Should Come Next?","Sat, 04 Mar 2023 11:00:03 +0000",Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has rejected calls by the opposition for a full public inquiry.,Ian Austen,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/04/world/canada/china-elections.html,"But the issue flared up on Feb. 17 when The Globe and Mail published an article it said was based on secret and top-secret reports prepared by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, the agency most English-speaking Canadians know as CSIS.

According to the article, the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party did not want a Conservative government to win the 2021 election because it feared it would take a hard-line approach to China. The Chinese leadership, however, wasn’t entirely happy with the Liberals, either, and wanted to hold them to a minority government. While that ultimately was the result, it’s difficult to see how any outside government could engineer such an outcome.

The documents, as reported by The Globe, laid out a variety of strategies, not all of them obviously feasible. China asked its diplomats in Canada to swing the vote in favor of the Liberal candidates in constituencies with large Chinese populations. And the documents the newspaper cited included boasts some of those diplomats conveyed back to Beijing that they had successfully defeated Conservative candidates, although there is nothing to back their claims.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, citing secrecy laws, has not addressed any of the specific allegations, but he has criticized the article and other reports for containing inaccuracies, without elaborating.

The Conservatives, who of course were the target, swiftly demanded a public inquiry, and Pierre Poilievre, their leader, charged that Mr. Trudeau was covering up China’s actions."
Biden and Germany’s Scholz Meet Amid Concerns Over Ukraine and China,"Sat, 04 Mar 2023 02:23:01 +0000","President Biden said he and Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, would work in “lock step” to provide military support to Ukraine.",Katie Rogers,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/03/us/politics/biden-scholz-ukraine-china.html,"Still, she added a note of caution: “We have not seen China do anything yet as it relates to lethal weapons and we believe that Russia’s war in Ukraine has put China in a difficult position to actually move forward in that direction.”

In a statement on Friday, the White House said that the two leaders discussed their “commitment to impose costs on Russia for its aggression for as long as necessary,” and that they “exchanged perspectives on other global issues,” without naming China.

The meeting was unusually muted for such a high-level visit. There was no ceremony, and Mr. Scholz and Mr. Biden did not hold a news conference after their meeting. The chancellor also did not travel with a contingent of journalists, which would be typical.

The work-trip nature of the visit underscored the high-stakes conflict playing out overseas. On Friday, Washington announced it would send another arms and ammunition delivery to Ukraine, a package worth some $400 million that would include howitzers, large firearms that are reloaded with ammunition, and HIMARS launchers, which fire satellite-guided rockets with a range of around 50 miles.

“This is a very, very important year because of the dangerous threat to peace that comes from Russia invading Ukraine,” Mr. Scholz said to reporters, adding that it was important to send a united message on protecting Ukraine. “At this time I think it’s very important that we give the message that we will continue to do so as long as it takes.”

Mr. Biden has stressed the importance of working as an international collective as public support for arming the Ukrainians flags and some congressional Republicans balk at the price tag as an election year approaches. Mr. Scholz, who faces an election in 2025, needs to return to Germany with assurance from an American president that the two will cooperate, said Jackson Janes, a resident senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund, a nonpartisan policy organization.

“They need each other for domestic purposes,” Mr. Janes said, “to be clear about the fact that they’re both going to be facing some headwinds with regard to the long run sustainability of political support in both countries.”"

Russia launched its offensive to take Bakhmut in August, and the fighting has rarely relented since. ‌Though Ukraine has put up a stiff defense, in recent weeks Moscow’s forces have made gains that put the critical roads in and out of the city in jeopardy.

Those roads are vital to resupplying the troops, but also for a retreat if needed.

For the moment, commanders say they have pushed Russian troops back a bit, reducing the threat of artillery fire on a main highway that leads southwest out of the city."

During the conference, Mr. Garland “reaffirmed our determination to hold Russia accountable for crimes committed in its unjust and unprovoked invasion against its sovereign neighbor,” the email said.

Mr. Zelensky, in his nightly address, said the thrust of the conference was to hold Russia’s leadership to account for atrocities committed by its army, a position he has hammered home repeatedly over the last year of war. “The main issue of all these meetings and the Lviv conference is accountability,” he said."

Longtime subscribers won’t be surprised that my reading list starts with Joan Didion. She isn’t a historian or political scientist, but she had a unique gift for describing the self-mythology of American cities and then finding, in plain sight for anyone who cared to look, the contradictions that fatally lacerate those myths.

“Sentimental Journeys,” her novella-length article for the New York Review of Books, was nominally a report on the Central Park Five rape trial, but was really an exploration of the deep corruption of New York City politics. “Crimes are universally understood to be news to the extent that they offer, however erroneously, a story, a lesson, a high concept,” she wrote. The Central Park rape case was a way to tell a story about who and what New Yorkers should fear, and who could protect them, in a way that distracted from the corrupt dealings that were more immediately relevant to New Yorkers’ lives.

“The extent to which Los Angeles was literally invented by the Los Angeles Times and by its owners, Harrison Gray Otis and his descendants in the Chandler family, remains hard for people in less recent parts of the country to fully apprehend,” Didion wrote in a 1990 Letter from Los Angeles column in The New Yorker. In her swift retelling of that invention, Los Angeles is little more than a series of sales pitches stacked on top of each other, each one making promises about endless opportunities that eventually crumble on contact with reality, leaving ordinary citizens in economic or mortal peril. (I followed that up with some of Mike Davis’s work, particularly his classics “City of Quartz: Excavating the Future in Los Angeles” and “The Case for Letting Malibu Burn.”)

Didion’s “Miami” is usually seen as a book about Cuban expatriates in Florida. They are, to be fair, its main subjects. But I think that when paired with “Salvador,” her travelogue about a reporting trip during El Salvador’s civil war, it’s better understood as a book about how much Americans were kidding themselves about being somehow categorically different from Latin America. It reminded me of “Paths out of Dixie: The Democratization of Authoritarian Enclaves in America’s Deep South,” by Robert Mickey, which makes a strong case that comparisons to Latin America, not Europe, are often the most informative way to understand U.S. history."
Thai Hunger Strikers Calling for Changes to Monarchy Are at Risk of Dying,"Sat, 04 Mar 2023 05:45:01 +0000","The two young women have not had food for 44 days, part of a campaign urging the government to repeal a law that criminalizes criticizing the royal family.",Sui-Lee Wee,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/03/world/asia/thailand-hunger-strike.html,"A stream of protesters outside the Supreme Court in Bangkok held up the three-fingered salute — a symbol of defiance against the government. “Fight, fight, fight,” they yelled to two young women who were taken out of a makeshift tent in stretchers, both so weak that they could not open their eyes.

The women, Tantawan “Tawan” Tuatulanon, 21, and Orawan “Bam” Phuphong, 23, were taken to a hospital on Friday evening after their family members and lawyer said that they were on the brink of death. They were on their 44th day of a hunger strike, protesting the detention of Thai political prisoners, calling for judiciary changes and the repeal of a law that criminalizes criticizing the Thai monarchy.

Their plight has been discussed by Thailand’s House of Representatives and has drawn urgent expressions of concern from international human rights groups, which have called on the government to engage with the activists.

In 2022, both women were accused of violating the law against criticizing the monarchy after they conducted a poll asking whether the royal motorcade was an inconvenience to Bangkok residents. They were released on bail in March that year under the condition that they no longer participate in protests or organize activities that defame the royal family."

“The visit will celebrate Britain’s relationship with France and Germany, marking our shared histories, culture and values,” said a statement from the palace. “It will also provide an opportunity to look forwards and demonstrate the many ways the U.K. is working in partnership with France and Germany, whether that be to tackle climate change; respond to the conflict in Ukraine; seize trade and investment opportunities or share the best of our arts and culture.”

In choosing France and Germany, the two largest economies of the European Union, for his first official visits, King Charles is signaling Britain’s intention to strengthen ties after Brexit negotiations sowed divisions.

For the French portion of the trip, which begins March 26, the royal couple will join President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte, in Paris for a ceremony of remembrance and wreath laying at the Arc de Triomphe.

Known as HIMARS, those launchers have, over the past year, proved crucial in bolstering Ukraine’s momentum in the war.

U.S. officials said that the rockets are included in a new $400 million package of military aid announced on Friday by Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken.

The new package comes as President Biden hosts a short visit by Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, bringing the total value of American military aid to Ukraine to more than $32 billion since February 2022."

He added that most of the human remains had been removed from the crash site, though rescuers were still pulling out the charred remains of belongings such as backpacks, cellphones and laptops.

Even though the official death toll was 57 as of Friday afternoon, there was an element of confusion: Only 56 people have been reported as missing by relatives. “There is the possibility that a missing passenger was not reported by relatives or that others boarded at stations along the route,” Mr. Artopios said.

The Greek police were notifying relatives of the dead after family members submitted their DNA for identification. A total of 36 matches were confirmed as the authorities went through the painstaking process and continued to carry out tests on remains retrieved from the site.

Constantina Dimoglidou, a spokeswoman for the Greek police, said that it was not yet clear whether those remains were from people who had already been identified. She added that mental-health professionals were assisting the police in informing relatives."
Why Is TikTok Being Banned?,"Fri, 03 Mar 2023 15:17:21 +0000","Governments have expressed concerns that TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, may endanger sensitive user data.",Sapna Maheshwari and Amanda Holpuch,https://www.nytimes.com/article/tiktok-ban.html,"In January, a Republican senator, Josh Hawley of Missouri, introduced a bill to ban TikTok for all Americans after pushing for a measure, which passed in December as part of a spending package, that banned TikTok on all devices issued by the federal government. A separate bipartisan bill, introduced in December, also sought to ban TikTok and target any similar social media companies from countries like Russia and Iran.

What is the Biden administration doing?

It’s been largely quiet, though the White House pointed to an ongoing review just this week, in response to questions about TikTok. TikTok has been in yearslong confidential talks with the administration’s review panel, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, to address questions about TikTok and ByteDance’s relationship with the Chinese government and the handling of user data. TikTok has said that it has heard close to nothing since its August submission of a 90-page proposal detailing how it planned to operate in the United States while addressing national security concerns.

Can the government ban an app?

Most of the existing TikTok bans have been implemented at governments and universities that have the power to keep an app off their devices or networks.

A broader, government-imposed ban that stops Americans from using an app that allows them to share their views and art could face legal challenges on First Amendment grounds, said Caitlin Chin, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. After all, large numbers of Americans, including elected officials and major news organizations like The New York Times and The Washington Post, now produce videos on TikTok.

“In democratic governments, the government can’t just ban free speech or expression without very strong and tailored grounds to do so and it’s just not clear that we have that yet,” said Ms. Chin.

What if I already have TikTok on my phone when a ban is issued?

The exact mechanism for banning an app on privately owned phones is unclear.

Ms. Chin said that the United States could block TikTok from selling advertisements or making updates to its systems, essentially making it nonfunctional.

Apple and other companies that operate app stores do block downloads of apps that no longer work. They also ban apps that carry inappropriate or illegal content, said Justin Cappos, a professor at the New York University Tandon School of Engineering."
China Increasingly Seen as Antagonist in Diplomatic Talks Globally,"Fri, 03 Mar 2023 13:51:34 +0000","Tensions over China arise in many gatherings of global leaders and diplomats, as Beijing increasingly plays a spoiler role, often siding with Russia.",Edward Wong,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/03/world/asia/china-diplomacy-beijing.html,"For President Biden and his aides, that tension came into sharp focus in recent weeks after a Chinese spy balloon began drifting over the continental United States, and when, in their telling, they came across intelligence that China is considering sending weapons to Russia for its war. That prospect has prompted American diplomats and those from allies and partners to deliver warnings to Chinese counterparts, including here in New Delhi.

The anxieties over both China’s and Russia’s increasingly discordant roles on the world stage were perhaps wrapped into a lament on Thursday by Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India that “multilateralism is in crisis today.”

“Global governance has failed in both its mandates” of preventing wars and fostering international cooperation, he said in a video address to a conference of top diplomats from the Group of 20 nations, made up of the world’s major economies, including China and Russia.

The four Asia-Pacific countries represented on the panel one day later at the Raisina Dialogue form the Quad partnership, which was revived in 2017 after many years of dormancy and has gained momentum since, mainly because of shared strategic concerns over China. But in a sign of the delicate balance they are trying to strike in relations with Beijing, the diplomats took pains to stress in their public comments that the Quad is not a security or military organization. Mr. Hayashi was the sole panelist to mention China, and only after being prompted by the panel’s moderator."
A New Child Care Requirement,"Fri, 03 Mar 2023 17:25:59 +0000",A great idea — or a problem for semiconductor makers?,German Lopez,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/03/briefing/child-care-mandate-chips-bill-biden.html,"The requirement could also ensure that a more diverse work force benefits from the federal funding. Women and people of color are more likely to have their jobs and lives disrupted by a lack of access to child care, Taryn Morrissey, a family policy expert at American University, said.

There is a point of historical comparison. During World War II, President Roosevelt — under pressure from civil rights activists — required factories to hire both white and Black workers. Like Biden, Roosevelt was using one policy (wartime production) to solve a problem (segregation) that on the surface seemed quite different. And like Biden, Roosevelt could argue that his policy would bring broader benefits, by expanding the number of available workers.

The case against

Making chips in the U.S. costs 44 percent more than it does in Taiwan, which has the world’s biggest maker of advanced computer chips, a Goldman Sachs analysis found. The higher cost is one reason that chip manufacturers left the U.S. in the first place.

Why is it so expensive to manufacture chips in the U.S.? Regulations and litigation can make it difficult to build just about anything in America, imposing costly standards on projects and slowing them down. Companies also pay workers more in the U.S. than in most other countries, increasing labor costs.

For its part, the Biden administration has established a team to help chip companies work through regulatory requirements quickly.

But the child care mandate could increase costs further. Those higher costs could force U.S. manufacturers to charge higher prices or accept lower profits than foreign competitors. That would work against the semiconductor law’s main goal: to make American chip producers more competitive globally.

“Everyone agrees the task is extraordinarily difficult,” said Adam Ozimek, the chief economist for the Economic Innovation Group, a think tank. “We should be doing everything we can to make it easier and nothing to make it harder.”"
The U.S. will send more ammunition to Ukraine.,"Fri, 03 Mar 2023 13:14:22 +0000",,Erin Mendell,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/03/world/europe/the-us-will-send-more-ammunition-to-ukraine.html,"The United States is set to send more aid to Ukraine, most of it ammunition for equipment such as HIMARS rocket launchers, before an anticipated Russian assault this spring.

At a press briefing in Washington on Thursday, John F. Kirby, the National Security Council spokesman, declined to give details on the size of the new aid package and did not offer a timeline for when it would be delivered. More information is expected to be released on Friday, he said.

Ukraine is running low on ammunition after a year of fighting Russia. The world’s biggest producers of ammunition cannot keep up with the pace of fighting, which is straining global arms production. Ukraine’s allies, including NATO members, are moving billions of dollars of equipment to Ukraine but are hampered by a patchwork of rules and the desire to replenish their own stockpiles.

Last week, the Pentagon said that it would spend $2 billion on equipment for the Ukrainian military so the country could sustain its long-term needs. The United States will buy that equipment, which includes ammunition for artillery and long-range rocket systems, from manufacturers instead of drawing from its own stockpile. That will delay the delivery by months or years."

Sign up to get it by email.

Two weeks ago, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, announced a new service that would give users exclusive features and a coveted blue verification check mark.

For a monthly subscription fee, users will get access to live customer support, measures of protection from impersonation, increased visibility and reach, and exclusive features to “express yourself in unique ways,” the company said. Users will also be able to use their government ID to authenticate their account and receive a verification check mark as long as the name on their account matches.

Following a similar move by Twitter a few months ago, the announcement has intensified debates about the ethics of asking users to pay for support and security features that many argue should be fundamental to social media platforms. One tech columnist compared the practice to a protection racket. Another labeled Meta’s service a “creator tax” — the cost of trying to grow a brand on Instagram or Facebook. (Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s chief executive, has said that verifying IDs and providing in-person customer support for all users would cost “a significant amount of money.”)

Ethical questions aside, I was curious about how the service would work. Meta has started offering it Australia and New Zealand users on a test-run basis, before it rolls it out in other countries including the U.S. So I tracked down three of the first users in Australia to ask them why they had signed up, what they thought of the service, and whether it was worth the cost."

But real partnership will hold risks and benefits for both sides.,Steven Erlanger,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/03/world/europe/ukraine-eu-nato.html,"BRUSSELS — When the European Union offered Ukraine a path to membership last year, it was in many ways an emotional response to the Russian invasion. Leaders were under pressure to show solidarity with the victims of aggression, even though many opposed the idea.

Since then, preoccupied with passing sanctions, scrounging up aid and scouring military inventories to send Ukraine weapons, few in Europe have focused seriously on what that commitment might actually mean.

But this is a courtship with consequences for the future, not only for Ukraine’s aspirations and survival, but also for Europe’s own security and finances. Ukrainian membership would reshape the bloc and its relationship with a post-conflict Russia. It would also provide the best path toward internal Ukrainian reform as the country worked to meet E.U. standards of transparency and rule of law.

But tensions are already growing between Europe’s desire to maintain its tough requirements and Ukraine’s demand for quick entry into a promised land that has given hope to the embattled country. European Union officials like Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, have been slow-walking expectations for Ukraine, a country that nearly all agree is fundamentally unprepared to join."

Mr. Hun Sen, who has been in power for 38 years, has said he is planning to run in that election and has anointed one of his sons, Lt. Gen. Hun Manet, to succeed him in the future.

“It is not right, unfair and can’t be accepted,” said Ang Oudom, one of Mr. Kem Sokha’s lawyers, after the sentence was announced. He said he would appeal but added, “It is a political case, and only politicians can decide.”

Blinken said he had used the unscheduled encounter, which lasted less than 10 minutes, to demand that Russia end its war on Ukraine, as well as to call for it to return to the New START nuclear arms control treaty.

Rail Safety Upgrade in Greece Is Hobbled by Delays and Neglect,"Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:56:24 +0000",The technology would have automatically stopped trains before they collided. Years of delays and neglect have left Greece with a hobbled system.,Monika Pronczuk and Sarah Hurtes,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/02/world/europe/greece-rail-safety.html,"Greece’s rail system consistently ranks among the continent’s most dangerous despite receiving $700 million in modernization money from the European Union over the past decade. And the installation of the new safety system became so bogged down that a senior government official quit last year to protest what he called “unjustifiable delays.”

The European Union expects its 27 member countries to put in place sophisticated new procedures known as the European Train Control System by the end of the decade. That system monitors trains and takes control when they go too fast, blow through red lights or end up on the wrong tracks. The European Union wants to expand cross-border train travel, and harmonizing safety standards across the bloc is part of that strategy.

But putting it into effect has been inconsistent, as evidenced by this week’s crash.

“If the European Train Control System would have been installed and working properly, it should have absolutely prevented something like this from happening,” said Jedde Hollewijn, the railways policy officer for the European Transport Workers’ Federation. “The intention is that all European countries implement this, and we know that Greece has been lagging significantly.”

Luxembourg, the bloc’s smallest and richest country, is already using the new system across its rails. Belgium plans to be fully operational by 2025. Others have upgraded their major routes. But even without the new technology, most rail systems have safety features to prevent head-on collisions. The French National Railway Safety Authority, for example, uses automatic braking systems and other technology."

“The weaponizing of the justice system against political opponents in the way that is done in Nicaragua is exactly what the Nazi regime did,” Jan-Michael Simon, who led the team of U.N.-appointed criminal justice experts, said in an interview.

“People massively stripped of their nationality and being expelled out of the country: This is exactly what the Nazis did too,” he added."

The unscheduled encounter with Sergey V. Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, at an international conference in New Delhi showed that the Biden administration saw a need to reestablish in-person diplomatic contacts with Moscow so the two governments can discuss the year-old war as well as issues beyond it.

Mr. Blinken said at a news conference on Thursday night that in addition to calling for Russia to halt its “war of aggression” in Ukraine, he told Mr. Lavrov that Russia should return to the New START nuclear arms control treaty it withdrew from last month and comply with its terms. And he once again urged Moscow to free Paul Whelan, an American citizen who the State Department says is wrongfully imprisoned on espionage charges."

The top diplomats from the U.S. and Russia held their first face-to-face meeting since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Antony Blinken, the U.S. secretary of state, met with Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, on the sidelines of a meeting of the Group of 20 countries in New Delhi yesterday that was dominated by tensions over the war.

The meeting suggested that the Biden administration wanted to keep lines of communication with Russia open even as Blinken told Lavrov that the U.S. would support Ukraine in its defense against Russia “for as long as it takes.”

At the G20 meeting, U.S. officials braced for a clash with China and India over the war. China has called for peace talks, a position that U.S. officials dismiss as a smoke screen that allows Russia and its partners to cast themselves as the reasonable parties. Russia and the West have argued for months over which side is more willing to negotiate. Blinken said this week that the U.S. saw “zero evidence” that President Vladimir Putin was serious about peace talks.

At the end of the meeting, the G20 diplomats issued a lower-level chair’s statement, rather than a consensus communiqué, because Russia and China refused to approve a denunciation of Russia’s war on Ukraine."

The next day, Mr. Osman, a 35-year-old former car salesman supporting two children back home in violence-wracked northern Nigeria, lost his construction job after the company said it could no longer employ migrants who had come to Tunisia illegally. Then, he said, his landlord started talking about evicting him, worried he would be penalized for having migrants on the property.

On Sunday, a group of Tunisians broke into Mr. Osman’s apartment, beat up the migrants he was living with and stole their passports and cellphones. By Monday afternoon, he felt he had no choice but to risk a taxi ride to the Nigerian Embassy in Tunis, the capital, hoping to secure some thin protection from a campaign of arrests that migrant associations and Tunisian rights groups say has swept up hundreds of Black foreigners over the last month.

“I am a poor person, a poor migrant living here in peace,” he said outside the embassy, where other Nigerians had begun camping, fearing for their safety. “I left my children in a very difficult situation, and here I find myself in another critical situation.”"

Private companies are launching thousands of satellites that are photobombing the telescope — producing long bright streaks and curves of light that can be impossible to remove. And the problem is only getting worse.

A study, published Thursday in the journal Nature Astronomy, reveals an increase in the percentage of images recorded by the Hubble that are spoiled by passing satellites. And the data goes only through 2021. Thousands more satellites have been launched since then by SpaceX and other companies, and many more are expected to go to orbit in the years ahead, affecting the Hubble and potentially other telescopes in space.

“We’re going to be living with this problem. And astronomy will be impacted,” said Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics who was not involved in the study. “There will be science that can’t be done. There will be science that’s significantly more expensive to do. There will be things that we miss.”"

It remained unclear what happened in the village, although the incursion appeared to be over by Thursday afternoon. The group that claimed responsibility, the Russian Volunteer Corps, is led by a Russian nationalist in exile who opposes Mr. Putin’s rule and has been fighting for the Ukrainian cause.

It is unclear whether the group operates with the assent of the Ukrainian government, as it claims.

In practice, as he outlined in a speech this week, this reset will mean a much-reduced military presence at six bases that will be converted into academies or hubs of new partnerships. He said it would involve “balanced, reciprocal and responsible” relations, respectful of African needs at a time of intense competition for influence and profit across the continent from Russia and China.

“Macron wants to salvage what he can,” said Thierry Vircoulon, a research associate at the French Institute of International Relations. “His first term was a failure, both in terms of the war on terrorism and the attempt to maintain French influence.”

An era is coming to an end. France left its colonies decades ago, but old habits and presumptions about French power and dominance across a swath of Africa have endured, symbolized by a significant military presence and the continued use of the colonial-era C.F.A. franc currency. French nostalgia for the zenith of their geostrategic influence sustained these tendencies."

The final, 226-page report said that the spy agency, MI5, had failed to act on two key pieces of intelligence about Salman Abedi, the 22-year-old suicide bomber, in the months leading up to the attack. Although the report did not specify what the intelligence was, it rejected earlier claims by MI5 that the information was related to “nonterrorist criminality.”

Had MI5 acted on the intelligence, the report outlined, there would have been a “realistic possibility” it would have taken actions to thwart the attack."

It used patterns it found in all that text to generate recommendations: Shrink the court size to reduce the distance players need to travel in wheelchairs. Lower the hoop and install a ramp leading up to it so students can roll the basketball into the net. Pair up players so each person has a buddy for support.

Snyder could have found this information through a simple Google search. He turned to ChatGPT because it produced complete paragraphs instead of delivering links that would have left him with more clicking and synthesizing to do.

The mayor, who refused to flee and for a while remained at his post after Russian forces swept into Kherson, was arrested in June and put in solitary confinement. In the fall, as Ukrainian forces advanced on the city, Mr. Kolykhaev’s jailers moved him deeper inside Russian-held territory, according to witnesses.

He has not been heard from since.

The disappearance has deepened questions swirling around Mr. Kolykhaev and the role he tried to play.

Amid the focus on the treaty, Ms. Langlois said, “We’re losing sight of the fact that these are human beings who are fleeing very, very difficult situations.” She added: “These are not bad people, even those whose applications are ultimately rejected. We can’t forget that, basically, these people are seeking to improve their lot, as we would all do.”

As the Supreme Court weighs the fate of the treaty, migrants continue to flow through the Roxham Road crossing, intensifying demands that it be closed.

But simply shutting it down, experts said, would likely push migrants to try to cross into Canada through more dangerous points along the country’s 5,500-mile border with the United States.

“It’s very unclear,” said Laura Macdonald, a political scientist at Carleton University, “how you would keep out tens of thousands of asylum claimants who think they have the right to cross the border from doing so.”

"When Clothes Fly Off, This Intimacy Coordinator Steps In","Thu, 02 Mar 2023 19:01:50 +0000",Jessica Steinrock’s work on intimate scenes in film has come to prominence as the entertainment industry reels from the litany of sexual abuses brought to light by the #MeToo movement.,Jennifer Harlan,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/02/business/intimacy-coordinator-sex-scenes-film-jessica-steinrock.html,"The pilot of “Yellowjackets” includes several intimate scenes, including one where two high schoolers, played by Sophie Nélisse and Jack Depew, have sex in a car, and another where a housewife, played by Melanie Lynskey, masturbates. Having Ms. Steinrock on set for those scenes was vital, Ms. Kusama said.

As a director, Ms. Kusama said she has always felt a deep empathy with how vulnerable actors are in these scenes and makes a point to check in. But even if she poses a question, it can be hard for an actor who is uncomfortable to respond honestly knowing how much is on the line. An intimacy coordinator, as a neutral party, is more likely to get an honest answer.

“Societally, sex is really hard to talk about,” Ms. Steinrock said. Her role is to “create more pathways of communication,” she explained, so the actors feel safe discussing any issues, big or small, that may come up.

Having an intimacy coordinator doesn’t just create a safer environment, Ms. Kusama said: It also makes for better, sexier art.

“It demands that you take responsibility for your story with the actors, that you actually say, Yeah, we’re depicting sex and here’s what it needs to mean — i.e. it needs to mean something,” she said. “And conversely, I can say to an intimacy coordinator, ‘You know, it feels like I’m watching two people peck each other on the cheek, and there’s zero heat here.’”

This is where the choreography piece of Ms. Steinrock’s job comes in: She can offer ways to use breath or adjust positions to make a scene more evocative."

Bola Tinubu, a former state governor and a powerful political kingmaker in Nigeria, was declared the West African nation’s next president yesterday after a closely fought contest. Tinubu won about 8.8 million votes, according to electoral officials, trailed by the opposition candidates Atiku Abubakar, with about seven million, and Peter Obi, with about 6.1 million.

For many Nigerians, Tinubu’s victory is a daunting prospect. He is a contentious figure who is widely perceived as corrupt, in poor health and a stalwart of the old guard. (He says he is 70, but some Nigerians think he is much older.) Others see him as a capable pair of hands who turned around Nigeria’s biggest city, Lagos, when he served as governor of Lagos State from 1999 to 2007.

A country of immense natural riches, bursting with talent — with big technology, music and film industries — Nigeria is also a nation where over 60 percent of the people live in poverty, millions of children are out of school and kidnapping is a daily risk. The country is also facing a major cash crisis after a poorly managed currency redesign.

Nicknames: Tinubu is often called Jagaban by his supporters. Meaning “big boss” or “boss of bosses,” it captures the power he wields and the deference he is often treated with as a result. Others refer to him as Balablu — a reference to a speech in which he tried and failed to say the word “hullabaloo,” and a form of shorthand to imply that he is inadequate for the job."

Among them is Auchan, one of France’s largest supermarket chains, which has kept its 230 stores in Russia open and says it intends to stay. The retailer has drawn the ire of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, and recently faced fresh calls for a boycott after a report that Auchan’s Russian subsidiary supplied donated food to the country’s military.

Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, his most formidable potential challenger for the 2024 nomination, sought to match Mr. Trump, criticizing what he called the “open-ended blank check” for Ukraine and saying “I don’t think it’s in our interest” to be involved in the fight for territory seized by Russia.

By contrast, the announced and unannounced Republican presidential candidates who do support aid to Ukraine, like former Vice President Mike Pence and Nikki Haley, the former ambassador to the United Nations, trail far behind those two front-runners.

Mr. Surabian said a rematch between Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump would sharpen the nation’s debate over Ukraine. “If Donald Trump is the nominee, I 100 percent expect him to prosecute the case against Biden directly on the Ukraine issue,” he said. “I think this will become a centerpiece issue between him and Biden.”

So far, Congress has approved $113 billion in military, economic, humanitarian and other aid for Ukraine, not all of which has been spent yet. Anticipating trouble from the new Republican House, the White House and lame-duck Democratic majority last winter pushed through an aid package large enough to last until summer. At the current rate of spending, it would run out by mid-July, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

A House Democrat who asked not to be identified speaking critically of the White House expressed concern that the president’s team did not fully grasp how Americans viewed the aid. While they support Ukraine in principle, this Democrat said, the way the aid has been doled out through a steady drumbeat of announcements of another $500 million or $1 billion every week or two exacerbates the sense that endless funds are heading out of the country.

Philip D. Zelikow, a University of Virginia scholar and former State Department counselor, said military aid was more popular than economic aid because much of it is actually spent on arms produced by American defense firms. But he said that economic aid was critical to rebuilding Ukraine, and he argued that seizing $300 billion in Russian assets in the West for reconstruction would ease the burden on the American taxpayer."

More critically, Ms. Maliar, speaking on Ukrainian television, did not say what their role would be, in a battle that has left the ravaged Bakhmut a city in name only.

The new forces could be used to dig in and try to hold onto the territory, exacting the maximum casualties on the Russians, who have lost thousands of troops in repeated, futile assaults on Ukrainian positions. They might be used to tie down Russian forces so they cannot redeploy to other battles. Or they might be there to offer logistical support for Ukraine’s long-rumored withdrawal from Bakhmut.

That last explanation seemed to gain some ground this week when another Ukrainian official, the economic adviser Alexander Rodnyansky, laid out the challenges in an interview with CNN."
