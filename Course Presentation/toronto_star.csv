Toronto to ban parking on major snow routes as city workers dig out,"Sat, 4 Mar 2023 10:02:00 EST",Jennifer Pagliaro - Crime Reporter,https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2023/03/04/toronto-storm-may-be-over-but-get-ready-for-high-winds.html,"Toronto crews are working to dig out the city after a big storm overnight, declaring a major snowstorm condition which gives officials more power to clear major routes.

Barbara Gray, who as head the city’s Transportation Services is responsible for snow clearing, said in a press conference Saturday that the snowfall overnight was more than the typical storm but not beyond the city’s capabilities.

Gray said they are focusing on “mobility and accessibility” for residents and visitors but noted sidewalk clearing “is proving challenging” because of the toll it takes on the smaller equipment needed to do that work.

As for roads, Gray said: “Crews are making every effort to plow the snow to the curb.”

She has declared a major snowstorm condition which allows the city to prohibit parking on snow routes to allow crews to clear the snow more efficiently. Residents parking along those routes, which are marked and will get bright orange signs to let car owners know, will have until Monday to remove their vehicles.

While clearing is underway, snow removal won’t occur until Monday evening, Gray said.

Snow routes are largely along major arterial roads and will be marked with additional, bright orange signage.

Gray said residents can help the city by clearing the paths in front of their homes and help their neighbours — especially seniors and those with mobility issues. Residents requiring help can also call 211 for local services.

Here’s what else you need to know:

The winter storm warning issued by Environment Canada for Toronto ended this morning at 8:34 a.m., but that doesn’t mean business as usual.

The weather service says winds are expected to be gusting up to 50 kilometres per hour later this afternoon, with a high of 2C. Temperatures will rise to a high of 7C tomorrow, according to Environment Canada. We’ll check on how the city is preparing for a possible melt.

On the city’s end, all recreation and indoor arenas will be closed today and all scheduled programming is cancelled — that means swim classes, indoor skating and all drop-in programs. Permits are also cancelled. A tweet from the City of Toronto’s official account said classes would be made up at the end of the season where possible. The city said centres are expected to open Sunday as normal.

For those looking for respite, Metro Hall remains open as a warming centre and Agincourt, John Innes, Masaryk-Cowan and Regent Park community centres remain open for shelter only.

Toronto History Museums and cultural centres will also be closed.

But don’t worry, outdoor recreation is a go if you want to enjoy the snowfall — the city has a list of toboggan locations along with safety tips.

Toronto Hydro was dealing with scattered outages last night and tweeted this morning they were responding to “multiple safety emergencies” like downed wires. The tweet said they were not able to provide estimated times that those issues would be resolved but that crews “are working as quickly and safely as possible.”

The utility’s outage map showed clusters of customers impacted as of 9:30 a.m., with the largest outage appearing to between Bloor Street West and Dundas Street West and Dufferin Street and Christie Street in the city’s west end.

Plows and salt trucks are working across the city, but due to the storm the city is suspending service requests. Any emergencies should be reported to 311. Residents can check with the city’s PlowTO map for recent clearing.

If you’re trying to get around on transit today, check the TTC’s service alerts before leaving because there are several routes and stops that are delayed or not operating due to weather conditions or issues like downed wires. Line 3, the Scarborough RT, is completely shutdown and shuttle buses are running between Kennedy and McCowan stations.

Toronto Pearson Airport tweeted that “lingering effects” of the storm may affect flights still and warned travellers to check their flight’s status before travelling to Pearson. The airport’s departures updates showed multiple delays before 10 a.m. Saturday.

Winter storm updates: Toronto declares ‘major snowstorm condition’ to help clear routes; Thousands still without power,"Sat, 4 Mar 2023 07:27:00 EST",Star staff,https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2023/03/04/winter-storm-updates-toronto-gets-hit-with-20-to-30-cm-of-snow-most-city-facilities-closed-saturday.html,"KEY FACTS Snow removal process to go into next week

Several Toronto schools reopen Saturday

Environment Canada ends winter storm warning

A winter storm has ended in Toronto after the city was hit with 20 to 30 cm of snow. Follow along here for live updates on weather, travel, cancellations and everything you need to know about how the snowstorm is impacting the city.

3:15 p.m.: City urges safety during snow-removal

The city of Toronto is asking residents to move vehicles off of designated snow routes, clear private walkways and drive slowly as the process of removing snow will take days.

Here are some guidlines the city offered in a press release:

Residents must move vehicles parked on designated snow routes to enable crews to clear and remove snow on these important roadways.

Residents are encouraged to clear the private walkways and paths as soon as possible and help neighbours, especially those who are seniors or have mobility issues.

211 is a great resource that can connect seniors and those with mobility needs with community services and assistance.

People driving should slow down, follow at a safe distance, watch out for pedestrians and people cycling, and stay alert at all times, especially when approaching transit stops and intersections.

Everyone is asked to keep a safe distance from snow clearing equipment and crews before, during and after the storm and to let them complete their work safely.

2:30 p.m.: One-third of flights cancelled out of Pearson

The winter storm in Toronto has impacted those flying in and out of Pearson Airport.

According to the airport’s website, 33.33 per cent of departures were cancelled on Saturday and 37.6 per cent of arrivals were cancelled.

Earlier Pearson issued a statement advising customers to check with their airlines regarding the status of their flights.

2:25 p.m.: No power? Follow these tips

Toronto Hydro provided an outage tip as thousands of customers continue to be without power.

“To help stay warm during an outage, try to pick one room to stay in and place towels under doors and windows; wear multiple layers of loose clothing and blankets; and remember to eat and drink to provide your body with energy,” the company said.

2:11 p.m.: Toronto gets more snow than Ottawa, Hamilton

Environment Canada meteorologist Haizhen Sun says between 22 and 30 cm of snow fell on the Greater Toronto Area as of 6 a.m. today, prompting the city of Toronto to declare a “major snowstorm condition” that bars residents from parking on designated routes for the next three days.

Ottawa logged 14 centimetres of snow and Hamilton reported 15 cm.

1:51 p.m.: One man dead after highway collision

One man is dead after a fatal collision involving multiple cars on Highway 401.

In a press release, the Ontario Provincial Police said the crash happened around 9:30 a.m. and involved three cars in the express lanes near the Port Union exit.

Police said a man lost control of his car while driving into the snow-covered right lane of the highway.

The man’s vehicle rolled and was struck by two other cars before stopping in the middle of three lanes.

Police pronounced the 47-year-old man dead at the scene.

The eastbound express lanes are closed at Meadowvale Road and are expected to open around 2:30 p.m., police said.

1:41 p.m.: Snow removal will continue into Monday

Snow clearing operations began overnight and are underway across Toronto as some plows have begun their third pass of major streets.

The city says clearing operations are expected to continue into next week as multiple passes of equipment will be required to clear roads, sidewalks and bike lanes.

Snow removal operations are anticipated to begin Monday evening to ensure safety and accessibility. In preparation, the city is opening four designated snow dump sites.

12:59 p.m.: City provides update on warming centres

The City of Toronto says the warming centre at Metro Hall (55 John St.) remains open today.

Warming centres at Scarborough Civic Centre, Mitchell Field Community Centre and Cecil Community Centre are closing to new admissions today. Staff are working to provide clients who remain on site with a referral to a shelter or 24-hour respite site, the city says, adding that a number of daytime drop-in programs are also available across the city.

More information about drop-ins, and warming centres can be found here.

12:38 p.m.: More Toronto residents without power

Approximately 6,000 Toronto residents are without power, which is about 1,000 more than was reported this morning as wind and snow continues to cause problems.

The largest outage appears to be near Baview Ave. and Moore Ave. in the East York area.

12:12 p.m.: TTC closure update

According to the TTC, there are 41 bus stops that have been removed from service until further notice due to severe weather.

A full list of bus stops out of service can be found by clicking here.

Here are some more service alerts from the TTC:

All express route service except 900 Airport Express and Highway 27 Express have been cancelled due to inclement weather conditions.

Line 3 Scarborough were taken out of service at until further notice due to weather conditions. Shuttle buses are running between Kennedy and McCowan stations.

No service between Humberwood Blvd. Loop at View Green Cres. and Rexdale Blvd. at Queen’s Plate Dr. E. due to weather conditions.

11:20 a.m.: Toronto declares ‘major snowstorm condition’

Toronto has declared a major snowstorm condition to help clear major routes.

It allows the city to prohibit parking on snow routes to allow crews to clear the snow more efficiently. Residents parking along those routes, which are marked and will get bright orange signs to let car owners know, will have until Monday to remove their vehicles.

Barbara Gray, who as head the city’s Transportation Services is responsible for snow clearing, said in a press conference Saturday that the snowfall overnight was more than the typical storm but not beyond the city’s capabilities.

As for roads, Gray said: “Crews are making every effort to plow the snow to the curb.”

11:11 a.m.: Toronto schools start to reopen

Some universities in Toronto and the GTA announced they are reopening on Saturday after weather-related closures on Friday.

Toronto Metropolitan University said its campus will reopen and activities will resume as usual as of 12 p.m.

The Ontario College of Art and Design (OCAD), George Brown College, and the University of Toronto Scarborough and Mississauga locations also announced on Twitter that they will reopen on Saturday.

10:54 a.m.: Goodbye heavy snow, hello high winds

The winter storm warning issued by Environment Canada for Toronto ended this morning at 8:34 a.m., but that doesn’t mean business as usual.

The weather service says winds are expected to be gusting up to 50 kilometres per hour later this afternoon, with a high of 2C. Temperatures will rise to a high of 7C tomorrow, according to Environment Canada. We’ll check on how the city is preparing for a possible melt.

10:44 a.m.: Toronto Zoo snowed-in

Anyone hoping to make a snowy trip to see some animals will have to change plans, as the The Toronto Zoo announced it will be closed on Saturday.

“Please note that the Zoo will be closed today after last night’s inclement weather while we allow our team to complete snow removal on-site,” the announcement said.

10:08 a.m.: Residents react to rare thundersnow

It wasn’t just the heavy snowfall that hit Toronto on Saturday. If you’ve been following our live coverage, you know all about the thundersnow by now. But have you seen how Toronto residents reacted to the rare weather event?

Here’s a handful of videos we’ve gathered: ‘Gotta love nature.’ Toronto residents react to rare thundersnow with excitement and confusion

9:30 a.m.: Toronto flights still impacted

Toronto Pearson Airport provided a reminder to customers on Twitter that their flights may still be impacted by the storm.

“Lingering effects from yesterday’s winter storm might still affect your flight. Don’t forget to check your flight status before you leave for the airport. Drive safe,” the airline tweeted.

The airport suggests checking with your airline to check your flight status.

9:16 a.m.: Storm wreaks havoc on TTC

The TTC continues to experience delays and service disruptions due to weather conditions across the city.

There is a growing list of cancellations, detours and delays. To see the list of all TTC service alerts, click here.

8:53 a.m.: TTC cancels planned subway closure

The TTC cancelled a planned closure of Line 1 due to the winter storm and deployed shuttle busses to priority routes.

The TTC initially said Thursday that subway stations north of Bloor-Yonge to York Mills would not have service on Saturday and Sunday due to signal system upgrades. The stations included Rosedale, Summerhill, St. Clair, Davisville, Eglinton and Lawrence.

However, due to the Toronto snowstorm, the transit agency announced Friday that regular service will run on Line 1. Approximately 50 additional buses will also run on routes that see a high volume of commuters on weekends and on roads that “offer essential connections to shopping and medical facilities and are primarily located in Neighbourhood Improvement Areas,” the TTC stated on their website.

8:34 a.m.: Winter storm warning ended

The winter storm warning has officially ended.

Environment Canada issued the statement as the overnight storm that saw Toronto get hit by 20 to 30 cm of snow has concluded.

8:29 a.m.: Toronto Hydro provides update

As more than 5,000 Toronto residents remain without power, Toronto Hydro provided an update on Twitter this morning.

“As a result of last night’s winter storm, we’re responding to multiple safety emergencies (downed wires) and outages across the city. We’re not able to provide ETRs at this moment, but please know that our crews are working as quickly and safely as possible.”

8:26 a.m.: A long winter

Now that this snowfall has ended, can we look forward to spring weather soon? Not quite.

Ontarians — and many Canadians — can expect even more wintry weather throughout March and April before a “sluggish start” to spring, according to The Weather Network’s spring forecast, published Wednesday.

“Winter lacked commitment this year as episodes of severe winter weather were followed by extended periods of early springlike weather,” said Chris Scott, chief meteorologist with The Weather Network, in a press release.

“However, it appears that winter will attempt to make up for lost time during March and even into April,” he added. “Several more rounds of wintry weather are expected across the country before spring finally hits its stride.”

8:20 a.m.: More residents without power

The latest Toronto Hydro outage numbers indicate approximately 5,000 residents are without power in the city.

That’s a steady rise from the 4,000 residents reported about an hour ago.

You can view the Toronto Hydro outage map here.

8:15 a.m.: No more snow

Environment Canada says the winter storm ended this morning, but hazards and dangerous driving conditions remain as blowing snow causes reduced visibility and slush or snow-covered roads create difficult driving conditions.

It’s expected to be cloudy throughout the rest of the morning before sunshine this afternoon with a temperature of 2 C.

8:08 a.m.: What is thundersnow?

Toronto residents couldn’t stop talking about thundersnow that rolled into the city last night. But what exactly is it?

Thundersnow is a rare winter phenomenon when, instead of rain, snow is the main precipitation during a storm. Like thunderstorms, thundersnow includes thunder and lightning — usually in flashes of blue due to the high concentration of ice crystals in the air. However, the snow typically dampens the sound of thunder.

Mark Robinson, a Toronto-based storm chaser for The Weather Network, told the Star that thundersnow is an “incredibly rare” phenomenon.

“If you see it tonight, consider yourself super lucky,” Robinson said, adding that he’d never seen so much lightning during a snowstorm in his entire life.

7:48 a.m.: Local hockey cancelled

The Greater Toronto Hockey League is postponing all ‘A,’ ‘AA,’ and ‘AAA’ games scheduled for Saturday due to weather conditions.

All games will be rescheduled for a later date, the league announced.

7:36 a.m.: About 4,000 Toronto residents still without power

Toronto Hydro continues to respond to power outages this morning, where approximately 4,000 customers are impacted.

The largest outage appears to be in Etobicoke, stretching from Eglinton Ave. W. and Martin Grove Rd. to Rathburn Rd. and Islington Ave.

You can view the Toronto Hydro outage map here.

7:30 a.m.: City facilities closed

The city has closed down several facilities on Saturday due to the weather conditions.

All community and recreation centres are closed and permits are cancelled

All 10 Toronto History Museums and four Cultural Centres and will be closed

All Toronto Public Library branches are closed

7:20 a.m.: Snow slowing down

With 20 to 30 cm already accumulated, Toronto is expected to receive about 2 cm of snow this morning before it clears at around 9 a.m.

7:15 a.m.: Winter storm warning continues

The winter storm warning continues in Toronto this morning but Environment Canada says it should end this morning. With 20 to 30 cm of snow accumulated, here are the hazards you should be aware of:

Significantly reduced visibility due to heavy snow and blowing snow.

Slush or snow-covered roads creating difficult driving conditions.

Isolated utility outages possible.

What will the weather be like this spring? Ontario is in for even more winter storms,"Fri, 3 Mar 2023 11:09:31 EST",Joshua Chong - Staff Reporter,https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2023/03/03/what-will-weather-be-like-this-spring-ontario-is-in-for-even-more-wintry-weather.html,"As southern Ontario braces for yet another snowstorm Friday, many are likely wondering when springlike weather will arrive for good.

It’s been a season of wild fluctuations in Ontario, with bouts of severe winter weather interspersed with days of extended thaws, perhaps providing false hope of spring’s imminent arrival.

But is milder weather on the horizon?

Additional rounds of wintry weather expected for Ontario

Ontarians — and many Canadians — can expect even more wintry weather throughout March and April before a “sluggish start” to spring, according to The Weather Network’s spring forecast, published Wednesday.

“Winter lacked commitment this year as episodes of severe winter weather were followed by extended periods of early springlike weather,” said Chris Scott, chief meteorologist with The Weather Network, in a press release.

“However, it appears that winter will attempt to make up for lost time during March and even into April,” he added. “Several more rounds of wintry weather are expected across the country before spring finally hits its stride.”

Unlike Canada’s groundhogs, which were at odds over spring’s arrival last month, there’s a general consensus among The Weather Network, Environment Canada and American forecasters, said David Phillips, a senior climatologist with Environment Canada.

“The operative word this season is patience,” he said. “We’ve come through a long stretch of milder than normal temperatures, and now in March, this could be the first month in almost a year that we have temperatures slightly below normal.”

How cold will Toronto be in early March?

In Toronto, specifically, The Weather Network’s 14-day temperature trend predicts daytime highs below historical averages for much of the first two full weeks of March.

Nighttime temperatures could plunge as low as -9C in the middle of the month, the forecast predicts.

Residents of southern Ontario, in particular, can expect above-normal precipitation, according to The Weather Network’s forecasts. The prediction calls for “messy winter storms” across Ontario and Quebec due to a few “moisture-laden systems” tracking across the region throughout March and parts of April.

“However, we are watching the potential for a strong ending to the season with warmer and drier weather,” the report said.

Wet, winter weather expected for much of the country

The extended wintry weather is a trend expected for much of the country. The forecast noted British Columbia will likely see an extended spring ski season, thanks to some cooler weather and above-normal precipitation.

Late-season winter storms are also called for in Atlantic Canada, which experienced “very mild” weather throughout the winter, the report noted. And in the Prairies, residents could see more wintry weather in March and April than during the heart of winter.

“We’ve got, frankly, more than a month before we can really start to talk about consistent warmth,” meteorologist Scott said in an interview with The Canadian Press.

The good news, however, is that above-normal precipitation across the country will help delay fire season in the west, Scott told The Canadian Press. As well, the lack of heavy winter snow mounds melting all at once will mean less water overflow in typically flood-prone areas, he said.

And looking ahead to the summer, Phillips at Environment Canada said his models predict a warmer than normal season.

Why this town is ground zero of Canada’s rising mortgage crisis,"Sat, 4 Mar 2023 06:00:00 EST",May Warren - Housing Reporter,https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2023/03/04/why-this-town-is-ground-zero-of-canadas-rising-mortgage-crisis.html,"Turning down a yet-to-be-paved road, local councillor Colin Best steers past a row of townhouses, some still covered in plastic construction wrap, others nearby with big blue ribbons on the doors welcoming owners, as dump trucks amble along ahead.

“Nine months ago, this was a corn field,” he says. “You go through a neighbourhood like this, one week there’s nobody here, the week after it’s just full of people.”

It’s nascent subdivisions like this — with streets so new that one is even named after the current mayor — where “you’re getting a lot of highly mortgaged people,” Best said. All in the first few years of ownership.

Welcome to Milton, a hive of development activity that’s also arguably ground zero of Canada’s mortgage crisis. The town has the most mortgage holders — 79 per cent of owner households — in the country, according to Statscan numbers recently crunched by Andy Yan, the director of the city program at Simon Fraser University. (In Toronto it’s 57 per cent, and nationally, 60 per cent.)

As interest rates have surged over the past year, with eight central bank rate hikes driving up mortgage costs and in many cases adding hundreds or even thousands of dollars to monthly bills, it’s already having a noticeable impact here in Milton — from a spike in food bank usage to investors off-loading properties to panic over approaching renewals.

“The recession’s not here, but there’s a lot of people on the edge,” Best said.

The Halton Region community, which sits on the outskirts of the GTA, has seen an explosion of growth in recent years. Much of it has been in the form of semis, townhomes and even condos, edging away from the suburban stereotype of the sprawling single family home. An older downtown, which ironically was the site of filming for the recent film “The Man from Toronto,” gives way to developments from the early 2000s, and the town is expanding with several new subdivisions to the south.

These newer builds, which attract a lot of young families and new Canadians, are one reason why Katherine Barnett, a broker at RE/MAX realty specialists Inc. and a Milton realtor, believes the town is so heavily mortgaged.

“They could afford so much because their money was almost free,” she said, referring to the historic low borrowing costs that fed the GTA housing frenzy of the past decade.

The average household income here is $138,800 a year, with an average home price of $1.06 million in February 2023, according to the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board — down 24 per cent from last year.

Barnett describes the town as “an expansive suburb of new builds that just keeps on going,” and said it makes sense that both groups are interested in newer homes. It’s a very young community, with an average age of just 35, according to Statscan, and over 50,000 immigrants in 2021.

The total population from the Census that year was almost 125,000, a 22 per cent jump from 2016. But Best said the town estimates the population is closer to 140,000 due to about 5,000 residents arriving and 1,500 babies born each year.

The young population means local schools are bursting at the seams with “an army of portables,” he said. But it also means that the population is vulnerable to increases in housing costs, like rising mortgage payments. Young first-time home buyers tend to have more debt and less equity in their homes.

“Younger people with huge debt want a new home because it’s much safer,” added Barnett. “They’re up to their eyeballs, car payments and all of it, so a new home is safe, you know for probably 10 years you’re not going to have to replace anything.”

But what might have seemed safe in recent years is fast becoming a burden. Local mortgage agent Agnes Mocko, said she’s “definitely seeing a lot of people struggling to keep up with their mortgage payments” especially those with variable rates, after eight rate hikes.

These types of mortgages were “super popular,” at the beginning of the pandemic into the start of 2022, she said, as rates were lower, and they allowed people to qualify for more. A variable rate could have been as low as 1.5 per cent in January 2021 for example, and can now be higher than five per cent.

According to the Bank of Canada variable mortgages now make up one-third of total outstanding mortgage debt nationally, up from about 20 per cent at the end of 2019.

“A lot of these people are struggling now because they couldn’t really afford it to begin with,” Mocko said.

Mocko is “slowly starting to see people get into sticky situations,” including those with a variable mortgage, as well as people who might have locked into a low fixed rate in 2018/19 and are facing renewal this year or next.

Robin Read Griffin, who bought her freehold townhouse in the “oldest of the new Milton,” in the early aughts, is already thinking about her renewal, even though it’s not coming up until 2025.

“I was panicking because I thought it was actually due for renewal this year,” said the 50-year-old entrepreneur, who co-owns a boutique marketing company, and locked in a two per cent rate for five years.

“The concern comes into play when it’s up for renewal and if things are not back on track.”

As a single parent, things are already tough enough.

“The cost of gas has gone up, hydro has gone up, food has gone up, everything seems to have gone up, with the exception of incomes.”

When Read Griffin bought her then brand new home in 2000 with her now late husband, there was still farmland across the street. They came from Mississauga and were attracted to the affordability, as well as the low property taxes. The couple also just loved the area — “close enough to the big city and the airport; but closer to the beauty of the Niagara Escarpment.”

The town has “changed drastically” since then.

She’s proud of the fact that Milton is a town, not a city, and still has a community feel. But it’s not as affordable as when she arrived. She recently had younger relatives hoping to buy who just couldn’t financially. “Now I stay because real estate prices have soared since then and it does not make sense to move,” she said.

Simon Fraser’s Yan said his data, on municipalities with over 100,000 people, “could be used as an indicator of vulnerability to increasing interest rates.”

In general, factors like demographic shifts might be at play. It’s also interesting to note, he said, that in and around both Toronto and Vancouver, the number of homeowners who are still paying off their homes “increases really the farther away you go from the central city.”

This reflects the “phantom affordability” of looking for cheaper housing through sprawl, which sometimes doesn’t actually work out once the cost of owning a car, a necessity in many of these communities, is factored in.

It’s true that home prices are still steep in Milton, but it seems that the “missing middle” or gentle density has finally arrived in the suburbs with some of the denser new builds.

“Unfortunately it’s still car dependent,” noted Best, who is also the president of the Association of Municipalities of Ontario, and has lived in Milton all his life.

“Construction cranes are popping up, it’s like War of the Worlds here,” he said, a reference to the towering, industrial aliens from the 2005 Steven Spielberg adaptation of the classic science fiction novel.

In fact, he said, there are currently eight cranes in town (historically they’ve had zero). Best jokes that Milton’s symbol should be a dump truck, because “that’s all you see in town.”

However even with all this growth, Best estimates about a dozen recent developments have been delayed, scaled back, or reduced as builders also grapple with rising interest rates, as well as labour shortages and higher construction costs.

“The interest rates are killing them, it’s not only the home buyers, it’s the builders that are affected,” he said.

The new neighbourhoods are still flanked by fields, with a fleeting view, at times, of Mount Nemo and the Escarpment, and the odd historic farmhouse that’s been relocated into a development, standing side-by-side with brand new homes.

Astronaut Hadfield’s family farm, which he shouted out from space, along with the local elementary school named after him, is still there in one of those fields.

Closer to the Go Station, where new planned condos are clustered, Best passes a mall, noting that it’s “dead” and slated for redevelopment once the store leases are up. But he adds that the premium outlet mall is still packed.

“You’ve got extremes,” he added. “Some people are just barely making it through, and other people, they’ve got loads of cash.”

It’s something Irshad Ahmad, Executive Director of the Milton Halal Food Bank, is keenly aware of. He said they’ve seen a huge increase in demand for their services since summer 2022. They’re also getting people coming in reporting that rising rents and mortgage payments are crippling them.

“It’s a peak which we never have seen before, and could not even imagine,” he said. Demand was “stable” during the height of the pandemic, but rising interest rates, along with higher food prices and inflation have created a perfect storm.

“People pay their mortgages or the rent, or they bring the groceries,” he said. “They can’t do both.”

On the other end of the spectrum, Chuck and Melissa Charlton, a husband-and-wife realtor team in Milton that sell a lot of new builds, said they’re starting to see investors off-loading their properties.

Many of them favoured variable rates because they were lower and more flexible. Now their payments have gone up by hundreds of dollars a month, and “that’s often the final straw,” said Chuck. As for individuals, Melissa said they’re “definitely feeling the squeeze,” but they’re not yet at the point of having to sell.

“I think most people are of the opinion that this is a temporary blip, that the interest rates are almost like a storm that’s passing through and eventually it’s going to settle down,” Chuck said.

But at the same time, “it’s like the water is right up to their eyeballs right now, how long can you hang in that position for?”

Emergency crews respond to building collapse in North York,"Sat, 4 Mar 2023 12:53:42 EST",Ana Pereira - Staff Reporter,https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2023/03/04/emergency-crews-respond-to-building-collapse-in-north-york.html,"Emergency crews responded to a building collapse in an industrial area in North York on Saturday morning.

Part of a single-storey commercial building located near Signet Drive and Fenmar Drive collapsed at around 11:45 a.m., according to reports from police and Toronto Fire.

Police were advised that there were no occupants inside the building at the time.

The cause of the collapse may have been a weak spot from an old fire, police said in an update on Twitter at 1:30 p.m.

Toronto Fire Services, who were on scene with police, told the Star that there was a portion of the building undergoing renovations. City engineering inspectors have been contacted to analyze the cause of the collapse, according to Toronto Fire.

Roads were closed on Signet Drive, from Fenmar to Ormont, but have since reopened.

Is it time for your COVID booster? New federal guidelines tell you,"Fri, 3 Mar 2023 18:53:00 EST",Kelly Skjerven - Staff Reporter,https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2023/03/03/is-it-time-for-your-covid-booster-new-federal-guidelines-tell-you.html,"For those wondering if and when they should get their next COVID-19 booster shot, federal health officials have released new guidance.

Beginning in spring, an additional booster dose is recommended for adults 80 years of age and older, or those living in long-term-care homes or congregate living settings, either for seniors or those with complex medical-care needs, according to the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) guidance released Friday.

NACI also recommends that those 18 and older who are moderately to severely immunocompromised due to an underlying condition or treatment, as well as those between the ages of 65 and 79 if they haven’t had COVID-19, seek a booster.

“I think that’s smart policy because if you look at who is most likely to end up in the hospital or have bad outcomes, it’s this group of people,” said Dr. Fahad Razak, internal physician at St. Michael’s Hospital and former director of Ontario’s COVID-19 science advisory table.

As for the individuals who don’t fit into those categories, at this time NACI is only recommending another dose if they haven’t already received previously recommended doses — their initial two or three doses of vaccine and any type of booster this past fall.

NACI added they expect that enough supply of COVID-19 bivalent boosters will be available for recommended groups.

Vaccine protection against infection and symptoms has been shown to wane over time with the original monovalent COVID-19 vaccines, though according to NACI, protection against severe outcomes lasts longer than protection against symptomatic disease.

“Vaccine effectiveness against severe disease from booster doses is generally higher and more sustained than against infection,” NACI added.

The committee’s guidance added that some Canadian data suggests vaccine protection may reach a plateau for adults with hybrid immunity — those who had at least one exposure to COVID-19 and at least one vaccine dose.

NACI said those with hybrid immunity demonstrated little benefit from booster shots of the original mRNA vaccines in certain specific circumstances — health-care workers got little extra protection against infection/symptomatic disease from the Omicron subvariant BA.2; and non-institutionalized elderly populations gained little protection against hospitalization due to the Omicron subvariants BA.1, BA.2 and BA.4/5. (Current epidemiology shows Omicron sublineages continue to be the dominant strain of the virus.)

With testing no longer widespread and routine, Razak said researchers are relying on wastewater data to determine how much virus is spreading. That data shows a possible rise in infections over the last few weeks in Ontario.

“It’s remained relatively high now for over a year or so since Omicron first emerged — it’s never really gone down to very low levels like we saw previously between waves,” Razak said, adding this suggests that Omicron subvariants like BA.5, BA.2 and XBB.1.5 are each triggering a new wave of infections.

The good news, Razak said, is there hasn’t been a “meaningful rise in hospitalizations” right now. Razak credited this to prior infections and vaccinations leading to some level of durable immunity against severe disease in the population as a whole.

Dr. Isaac Bogoch, infectious disease physician, called the guidance a reasonable approach and added that we may see recommendations change with time.

“We know there’s various groups that are at much lower risk for severe COVID-19 who’ve already had two or three or more doses of vaccine and perhaps those groups aren’t really going to benefit much from a vaccine at this point in time,” Bogoch said, reiterating that this could change.

To help prevent infection and spread of COVID-19, Razak said it makes sense for the general population to wear a mask in crowded indoor settings like transit and grocery stories.

“Even if you’re not at high risk of ending up in hospital, infections can be very disruptive. It could be missed work, it could be missed family events, it could be missed school,” Razak said.

NACI said it will continue to monitor COVID-19 across the country as well as new evidence on vaccines, and will update recommendations if necessary.

"He spends his days caring for his wife, who has dementia. This is his lonely struggle, in photos","Sat, 4 Mar 2023 00:15:00 EST","Moira Welsh - Staff Reporter,Steve Russell - Staff Photographer",https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2023/03/04/why-caring-for-an-aging-spouse-can-be-a-lonely-struggle.html,"There was a time, in the late 1950s, when Bill Lynn was stationed in France, a young fighter pilot with the Royal Canadian Air Force who fell in love with a fellow Canadian, a military-base teacher named Margaret Belfry.

They married and returned to Canada, where Bill worked as an engineer and Marg as an educator, had a daughter, a son, and eventually retired. The Lynns dined out and frequented the theatre, as regular patrons of the Stratford Festival. Those were good years. Bill misses them.

Like tens of thousands of Canadians facing the passage of time, Bill, 88, is now a full-time caregiver to his 89-year-old spouse, who has dementia. Diagnosed a few years ago, Marg’s decline was quick. Twice a week, Bill receives two hours of Ontario-funded home care in the couple’s East Toronto home, a short-lived freedom that allows for grocery shopping and sometimes, coffee at the mall.

Bill is lonely. Yet he is not alone in this struggle. With few supports to help older adults living at home, it is increasingly normal to spend the later years in a life of devotion, and isolation.

In seven or so years, nearly one-quarter of Canadians will have reached the age of 65, part of a massive demographic of older adults who want to age in the community with help that barely exists.

The year 2030 sounds far away, but it’s not.

In photos: The daily life of Bill and Marg

While Bill worked as an electrical engineer, Margaret Belfry Lynn spent her career as an educator. Marg taught in East York, at a Department of National Defence school in France. Later, she worked as the elementary head of English at the Selwyn House School in Westmount in Montreal. In April of 2019, Marg was diagnosed with dementia although in hindsight, Bill says the signs began emerging at least a year earlier but they dismissed them as brain fog from a change in the dose of her thyroid medication. “I guess that was a misleading idea,” Bill says. As Bill watches Marg disappear into her dementia, their home falls into a daily routine of silence. “It’s difficult, to be honest, because we can’t think of anything to chat about. She has very little memory other than her early childhood and we’ve discussed that so many times. One of my problems is when she is up and awake, I can’t think of anything to do with her, to keep her active.”

After some 60 years together, Bill misses the life he and Marg once shared. “My whole life nowadays is just wishing,” he says. “I just wish it was five years ago. That we could still do the things we did five years ago. If we could just just go out and go to church on Sunday and visit restaurants and go to theatre and art galleries and stuff like that. Every summer we used to go to Stratford and see several plays. So that kind of thing has just gone by the board now.”

With Margaret sleeping for long blocks of time, Bill tries to lead her into the kitchen to make sure she eats during the increasingly short period that she is awake. “It’s often a race against time. When she gets up in the morning I try to get her juice and cereal and toast to her in time so that she doesn’t leave and go back into the bedroom. So for me, pretty much every meal is a race.” After eating Marg lies on the bed.

Every Monday and Thursday, Bill gets two hours of government-paid “respite” support, meant to offer him some time away from his caregiving duties. Once the personal support worker arrives, Bill heads out. Sometimes he goes to a nearby mall with a library and coffee shop. He brings a book and reads. Other than visiting the mall or buying groceries, Bill says he doesn’t know how to fill his window of free time.

On this day, Bill gathers the mail as he leaves. It’s one of the few daily tasks he does even on non-respite days. He says he feels comfortable leaving Marg alone in their condo for the few minutes it takes.

Bill sometimes visits the Toronto Public Library at Eglinton Square Shopping Centre, near Victoria Park and Eglinton Avenues. When Bill discovered that the library was closed for the New Year’s holiday on Jan. 2, he sat on a bench inside the mall, used his library membership to log into the system and read a new book. “The mall has everything,” he says. “That’s where I go to Tim Hortons. There’s a huge eating area, the library, the works.”

Sometimes Bill pops over to the gourmet grocery store in the plaza across the street to pick up a few items. He gives himself 15 to 20 minutes to return home to Marg, who, he says, can stay by herself for 30 minutes. Bill says the errands and the care he gives to Marg keep him busy. “In a way, it’s an activity that is sort of forcing me to stay active, in an inactive kind of way.”

To keep Marg safe, Bill covered the bottom half of the mirror in cardboard. She used to have conversations with the person looking back at her from the mirror and they didn’t always go well, so when Marg tried to hit the glass, Bill jury-rigged a safety device.

Sometimes, Marg enjoys the space in the shower where she sits quietly, and talks.

Bill and Margaret have lived in their East Toronto condo for a decade, after moving to Toronto from Montreal. There are several condominiums on his street, with a plaza in the centre.

As her dementia increased, Marg’s interests and memories focused on her childhood but Bill set up her computer on the bench in front of them that has photos on the screen of their children when they were young. Their daughter lives in the U.K. and their son is back and forth between Owen Sound and Toronto.

Bill Lynn keeps an eye on Marg as she walks in the apartment.

As a fighter pilot with the Royal Canadian Air Force, Bill was stationed in France from 1959 to 1963. “It was during the Cold War, for NATO,” he says. It wasn’t long after arriving that Bill met a smart young woman named Margaret Belfry, an elementary schoolteacher at the local military base. They married two years later. The beer steins, engraved with their names, are a memento from those days. “It’s been a long time since we drank from those,” he says.

Over the past month, Marg has been sleeping a lot during the day and night, says Bill. Sometimes she falls asleep on the chesterfied in their spare bedroom, giving Bill a moment to slip into their bedroom and make the bed. “It’s funny,” he says, “I went to military college and I can’t seem to survive one day without making the bed, although sometimes it’s at five o’clock in the afternoon.”

"Police tracked him down at the ‘Freedom Convoy.’ A year later, he’s still in jail on 61 gun charges","Sat, 4 Mar 2023 07:00:00 EST",Alex Ballingall - Ottawa Bureau,https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/2023/03/04/police-tracked-him-down-at-the-freedom-convoy-a-year-later-hes-still-in-jail-on-61-gun-charges.html,"OTTAWA—A man who police urgently tracked through his cellphone and arrested near the National War Memorial during last year’s “Freedom Convoy” occupation was charged with illegally possessing a collection of guns and bullets at his home north of Toronto, the Star has learned.

Police never publicized the incident, but emails tabled during the Emergencies Act inquiry revealed that, early on Feb. 17 last year, law enforcement searched a home in Keswick, near Lake Simcoe. When they found an array of weapons — including semi-automatic rifles, shotguns and machetes — officers scrambled to track down their suspect by “pinging” his phone, and located him near the protest occupation near Parliament Hill, according to the emails.

After police and border agents refused to disclose information about the arrest, a spokesperson for the federal prosecution service told the Star the man accused in the case is Mike Vukmanovic. According to documents from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, the 52-year-old faces 61 firearms-related charges after he was arrested on Feb. 17 last year and denied bail.

Vukmanovic’s mother, Slobodanka Jurcic, confirmed to the Star that her son was arrested that day near the War Memorial, and said he is currently jailed at the provincial corrections centre in Lindsay. Vukmanovic dismissed his lawyer several weeks ago, Jurcic said, and is now representing himself in the case.

According to Jurcic, it’s true Vukmanovic had guns in his home, but she said her son had no violent intentions and did not bring any of his weapons to the capital. He travelled there twice to attend what he considered “peaceful” protests against pandemic health measures, she said.

All of the charges relate to weapons found in Vukmanovic’s home. He is not charged with possessing any weapons while in Ottawa.

“He didn’t threaten anybody, he didn’t hurt anybody,” Jurcic said. “It breaks my heart for him.”

Asked why her son had a collection of guns, Jurcic said all she could say was that he was preparing for “the end of the world” due to his concern about the state of society. He had enough food at his house to last a year, she said.

“In his mind, the world is changing, and he wants to be protected.”

Vukmanovic is charged with 12 counts of possessing a firearm or ammunition contrary to an order not to have them; 11 counts of possessing a firearm without a licence; 11 counts of knowingly possessing a firearm without being the licence holder; and 11 counts of carelessly storing a firearm.

He is also accused of six counts of possessing a prohibited firearm with readily accessible ammunition; four counts of illegally manufacturing a firearm; one count each of possessing a prohibited overcapacity magazine, and knowing it was prohibited; and one count of illegally possessing 3,632 rounds of ammunition.

Vukmanovic’s charge sheet lists the guns he is alleged to have had in his home around the time he was arrested: two semi-automatic rifles, two shotguns, two bolt-action rifles and a 6-mm revolver. The charge sheet alleges he had parts to make four more “Glock-style” handguns with a 3-D printer.

Beyond that, he is accused of smuggling or trying to smuggle a “fully assembled prohibited handgun barrel and slide” into Canada near Windsor, Ont. around Jan. 25 last year, and of illegally importing that same type of gun part around that time.

Finally, Vukmanovic is charged with one count of possessing the proceeds of crime: $11,587.74 in cash, and an estimated $80,000 worth of gold and silver.

Court documents say he is seeking a bail review to get out of custody and intends to represent himself at his trial, which is set to begin next February.

The emails tabled at the inquiry last fall showed police were concerned about the man whose home they searched in Keswick on Feb. 17, more than two weeks into the so-called “Freedom Convoy” occupation around Parliament Hill. By then, the federal government had triggered the never-before-used Emergencies Act to quash the protests, which had also sparked blockades at border crossings across Canada.

RCMP had seized a cache of guns and body armour at one of them, in southern Alberta, days earlier, alleging four people were involved in a plot to kill police officers if they moved against the blockade.

According to emails submitted at the inquiry, the Ontario Provincial Police, Canada Border Services Agency and York Regional Police searched a Keswick home around 4 a.m. on Feb. 17. The emails said police found rifles, shotguns, ammunition and a 3-D printer with parts to make a “Glock-style handgun.”

One of the emails — with a subject line: “High Risk — Firearms Suspect” — also said police found machetes by the front door, a “full camouflage suit (similar to those worn by military),” and “several silver bars located throughout the house including in the freezer.” On top of that, “an anti-government/police notice” was taped to a storm door, the email said.

The suspect wasn’t home at the time, and a neighbour told police the suspect was in Ottawa, the email said, prompting concerns about threats to the public and law enforcement. Referring to the suspect’s cellphone number, OPP Asst. Dep. Sgt. Robin McKay wrote to other officers: “I believe an emergency track maybe (sic) warranted.”

In a subsequent email, sent just before 10 a.m., McKay confirmed the suspect’s phone was “just pinged” to within eight metres of the National War Memorial. Another officer responded about half an hour later, saying “looks like there is a team right to where his phone is pinging to.”

The next email, from OPP Supt. Pat Morris, informed his colleagues: “Subject in Custody.”

Vukmanovic is next scheduled to appear in court for a pretrial hearing on April 5.

"Doug Ford’s health plan is to add more ‘for-profit corporations,’ Liberals told","Sat, 4 Mar 2023 12:22:00 EST",Rob Ferguson - Queen's Park Bureau,https://www.thestar.com/politics/provincial/2023/03/04/doug-fords-health-plan-is-to-add-more-for-profit-corporations-liberals-told.html,"HAMILTON, Ont.—Danger lurks in Premier Doug Ford’s plan to move more surgeries out of hospitals and into private clinics, interim Liberal Leader John Fraser says as 1,500 activists gather to chart a course for the party’s leadership race.

“Ford’s plan is to add more for-profit corporations, pitting patients against shareholders,” Fraser said Saturday of the Progressive Conservative government’s proposal to ease wait times worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic.

“The last time somebody told us we needed more for-profit in the system, it was (former PC premier) Mike Harris, and it was about long-term care,” Fraser added in a speech prepared for the Ontario Liberal party’s annual general meeting.

“The pandemic showed us all just how wrong that direction was,” he continued in a reference to problems in for-profit nursing homes, including several that required emergency help from Canadian Armed Forces medical teams.

Health Minister Sylvia Jones will take proposals from not-for-profit and for-profit groups this summer to provide medical services such as cataract surgeries, MRIs, CT scans and hip and knee replacements, with Ford promising Ontarians “will pay with their OHIP card, never their credit card.”

Opposition parties have raised concerns the plan will weaken medicare and could end up with patients paying extra fees out-of-pocket.

Many delegates to the weekend convention arrived in a snowstorm Friday and vote Saturday on moving to a one-member, one-vote system for electing a new leader in the wake of last June’s defeat at the hands of Ford’s Conservatives, which prompted then-Liberal leader Steven Del Duca to resign on election night.

Hoping to get back to official party status after Ford’s 2018 landslide that ended 15 years of Liberal power, the party won eight seats — four shy of the 12 needed for about $2 million in additional funding as a recognized political party.

Several potential leadership candidates are jockeying for support at the convention, although a date for a leadership vote will not be set until this spring.

The convention is abuzz with leadership talk and would-be candidates hosting crowded hospitality suites.

Liberal MPs Yasir Naqvi (Ottawa Centre) and Nathaniel Erskine-Smith (Beaches—East York) both courted supporters at their suites, as did MPP Ted Hsu (Kingston and the Islands).

Mississauga Mayor Bonnie Crombie, now in her third term and touted by backers as a potential candidate with good name recognition, held sway at another suite.

“The field is wide open,” Fraser said. “We’re going to have a heck of a bigger race than the NDP,” he added in reference to New Democrat Leader Marit Stiles, who was the only one to seek her party’s leadership.

An Eaton Centre water park? Nordstrom closure has some dreaming big as prime Toronto real estate opens up,"Sat, 4 Mar 2023 05:00:00 EST",Josh Rubin - Business Reporter,https://www.thestar.com/business/2023/03/04/an-eaton-centre-water-park-nordstrom-closure-has-some-dreaming-big-as-prime-toronto-real-estate-opens-up.html,"For nearly five decades, the Toronto Eaton Centre has been anchored by a department store or clothing retailer. Could a water park, cluster of restaurants or conference centre be next?

With Nordstrom’s announcement this week that it’s pulling out of Canada, some of the most desirable commercial real estate in the country is suddenly up for grabs.

Retail and real estate experts say the cavernous space currently occupied by the U.S. retailer in downtown Toronto could become anything from a conference centre to yet another Toronto Metropolitan University outpost — or even a water park.

The least likely option, they say, would be another huge department store. Not in an era where more consumers are shopping online.

Whatever happens, the massive mall, home to more than 200 shops, will survive. As of 2019, it was the busiest shopping mall in Canada, with more than 50 million visitors per year, and its owner, commercial real estate giant Cadillac Fairview, is used to reinventing large spaces to accommodate new uses.

Big-box retailers such as Ikea are already in the neighbourhood, and fashion retailers have struggled since the COVID-19 pandemic, so that makes them an unlikely option, said retail analyst Lisa Hutcheson.

“It’s such a big space. Something entertainment-focused could really work. It would also be good for food and beverage,” said Hutcheson, managing partner at retail consultancy J.C. Williams Group. “I could also see conference rooms or maybe Toronto Metropolitan University could be interested in it.”

Nordstrom announced Thursday it was closing its 13 Canadian stores, including six operating under the main Nordstrom brand, and seven under the discount Nordstrom Rack banner. The stores will be closed by late June. Among the stores are three Nordstrom stores in Toronto, including the 220,000-square-foot location that opened with great fanfare in 2016 at the Eaton Centre, in a space that began as an Eaton’s when the mall opened in 1977, then eventually became a Sears.

As more consumers have been shopping online, malls and their tenants have been forced to adapt, to make the case that there’s still something gained to be walking into a store, rather than just clicking a mouse.

Hutcheson pointed to American Dream, a mall and entertainment complex in East Rutherford, N.J., which contains an indoor amusement park — complete with roller coasters and a minigolf course — as well as a water park, NHL-sized skating rink and an indoor ski resort.

“About 30 per of American Dream is entertainment based,” Hutcheson said.

While the space now occupied by Nordstrom could still end up having some retail use, Hutcheson doubts it would be filled by a single company — it’s just too big.

“That’s a really big space. It’s probably not going to be a single tenant. I think they’ll probably end up carving it up,” said Hutcheson, who also doubts any clothing-focused retailer will end up occupying the space.

The pandemic hammered clothing retailers worldwide, not least because it accelerated the work-from-home trend. That makes Hutcheson doubt that a fashion-dominated company like Quebec-based Simons would take over the space.

“To put in another fashion retailer, I don’t think that will work,” said Hutcheson.

A spokesperson forCadillac Fairview said the company is already looking for ways to fill the space.

“Cadillac Fairview is constantly assessing the ever-changing retail landscape, and while it’s too early to speculate what we will do with these spaces in the future, our team is working diligently to manage this change and work toward an outcome that is in the best interests of our centres and our long term success,” spokesperson Janine Ramparas said.

Coun. Chris Moise, who represents the area where the Eaton Centre is located, hopes the space will be split up into smaller units.

“Personally, I would like to see the space converted into smaller spaces like they did with the lower level of the old Sears. We’ve seen that these big-box department stores aren’t a successful model anymore,” said Moise.

On Twitter, some Toronto residents had their own suggestions, ranging from well-known retail names — both Canadian and international — to more recreational options.

“I vote to turn the Eaton Centre Nordstrom space into a laser tag arena and bowling alley,” tweeted Mona Hillis.

“With Nordstrom closing, it’s time for the Eaton Centre to reject modernity and embrace tradition,” wrote Mike Beauvais, alongside a picture of the Zeller’s logo replacing Nordstrom.

Others suggested Giant Tiger or Dollarama.

Kate Camenzuli, vice-president at commercial real estate brokerage CBRE, said Torontonians hoping for the largest dollar store in North American history will likely be disappointed. But there are major international retailers who’d love to crack the Canadian market in such a marquee location, said Camenzuli, who didn’t name specific retailers.

“These are institutional grade, phenomenal pieces of real estate. I think there’s going to be a lot of interest. I do think it will stay consumer-facing, and stay in some type of retail,” said Camenzuli, who specializes in retail real estate.

Camenzuli agreed that entertainment or restaurant operators could be a realistic option for the Nordstrom spaces at the Eaton Centre and other Canadian malls.

“The space is very well-suited for experiential things, food and beverage or entertainment. They’re all about the same asks. They’ve got their nuances but they’re very quick turnaround,” said Camenzuli. “If the right player came to town, every single one of those landlords would be able to accommodate anything that came in.”

Camenzuli scoffed at suggestions that mall landlords are overly concerned about the Nordstrom pullout.

“No one’s panicking. This is what the landlords do every day. They’re used to carving up space and making sure that it’s appropriate and suitable for new groups coming in,” Camenzuli said.

"‘Succession,’ ‘Ted Lasso’ and ‘Yellowjackets’ — March TV madness is here. Put these 11 shows on your must-watch list","Sat, 4 Mar 2023 09:00:00 EST",Debra Yeo - Toronto Star,https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/television/2023/03/04/succession-ted-lasso-and-yellowjackets-march-tv-madness-is-here-put-these-11-shows-on-your-must-watch-list.html,"March, it’s a middling month, isn’t it? One that teases spring while winter overstays its welcome, and can we put away these damn puffy coats already? If you’re a television fan, however, there’s enough going on this month to keep you glued to your screen and away from the changeable weather.

The fact that “Succession” and “Yellowjackets” are both back for new seasons — and just two days apart — is reason enough for a TV fan to cheer. Throw in the return of cult hit series “Luther” in a Netflix movie; new episodes of “Star Wars” spinoff “The Mandalorian” and Emmys darling “Ted Lasso”; the long — really long — awaited sequel to Mel Brooks’ “History of the World: Part I”; Kiefer Sutherland and Bob Odenkirk returning to series TV; the debut of “Daisy Jones & the Six”; a new horror show co-created by Donald Glover and I haven’t even gotten to the period dramas yet, a personal favourite.

Herewith, I give you 11 reasons (see, there’s so much I couldn’t stick to 10) why March might just be the most interesting month for TV all year. And note, if you’re behind on some of the shows I’m about to mention, there are spoilers ahead.

‘Succession’ makes its final moves

The Season 3 finale of “Succession” is up there with the best episodes of TV I’ve ever watched. Tom — yes, sycophantic Tom (Matthew Macfadyen) — stabbed wife Shiv (Sarah Snook) and her siblings deep in the back to make a deal with the devil, a.k.a. their father Logan Roy (Brian Cox), over control of the Roy media empire. How do you move on from a betrayal that epic? We’re about to find out as Season 4 debuts and creator Jesse Armstrong has made it known this is the last one. Can it top Season 3? I’m willing to bet a cousin Greg Rolex it can. March 26, 9 p.m., HBO/Crave

‘Yellowjackets’ goes back to the woods

This was one of the buzziest shows of 2021 and not because it has the name of a wasp in its title. The events in its dual timelines proved irresistible: teenage girls’ soccer team goes feral and cannibalistic in the wilderness after a plane crash in the 1990s; in the present, the now adult survivors struggle to keep the darkness of their past under wraps while indulging in more darkness. As Season 2 debuts, the show’s producers seem to be keeping the new plot twists close to their chests. We know that the killer main cast (pun intended) is returning, including Melanie Lynskey, Juliette Lewis and Christina Ricci, while new additions include Lauren Ambrose, Simone Kessell, Elijah Wood and Canadian François Arnaud. March 24, Crave

‘Luther’ is back and still brooding

British cop John Luther, played with broody intensity by Idris Elba, is kind of the ne plus ultra of troubled detectives: over five seasons his estranged wife was killed; two of his partners and other colleagues died; his serial killer lover was offed (well, apparently); he’s been accused of multiple murders. That’s a whole lot of trouble and then there are the gruesome homicides he’s had to solve. In the film “Luther: The Fallen Son,” Luther breaks out of jail to once again don his tweedy grey overcoat and take on another maniacal killer, played by Andy Serkis, to the displeasure of his former police bosses. The movie didn’t get great reviews on its theatrical release, but if you’re a “Luther” fan you’re going to watch it anyway. March 10, Netflix

‘The Mandalorian’ and Grogu ride again

Before Pedro Pascal captured our admiration as a reluctant father figure to Bella Ramsey’s character “In the Last of Us,” he captured our admiration as a reluctant father figure to Grogu, a.k.a. Baby Yoda, in space western “The Mandalorian.” Sure, “Andor” has been the most prestige TV-like of the “Star Wars” spinoffs so far, but don’t tell me you’re not reduced to a puddle of goo watching Pascal’s Din Djarin, a.k.a. Mando, with that big-eared baby alien as they travel the galaxy together. Season 3 debuted on Disney Plus last week and promises the usual mix of action scenes, cool guest stars (including Canada’s Paul Sun-Hyung Lee as Captain Carson Teva) and CGI creatures, but mostly we want to see Mando and Grogu bond. New episodes Wednesdays, Disney Plus

The last of ‘The Last of Us’ … for now

Speaking of “The Last of Us,” the video game adaptation that has become a major hit for HBO and its latest water-cooler show reaches the conclusion of its first season. I have seen the finale and won’t spoil anything for anybody, but if you’ve been enjoying the growing closeness between Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) you won’t be disappointed. And don’t worry, the show has already been renewed for a second season. March 12, 9 p.m., HBO/Crave

‘Ted Lasso’ is back on the pitch

It’s still an open question whether this third season of multi-Emmy-winning soccer sitcom “Ted Lasso” will be its last. If it is, it looks set to go out on its signature combination of corny humour and prodigious heart while promising a David and Goliath battle between AFC Richmond and rival West Ham United, now coached by former Lasso confidante turned villain Nate (Nick Mohammed). March 15, Apple TV Plus

‘Daisy Jones’ takes the spotlight

Book-to-screen adaptations are nothing new, but it’s fair to say “Daisy Jones & the Six” was one of the more anticipated transformations given the popularity of the 2019 Taylor Jenkins Reid book of the same name. Like the book, the show is about the meteoric rise and sudden fall of a famous 1970s rock band as told by the band members, in this case 20 years after the fact. Critics have not been kind since it debuted last week, but it got one thing right: its Daisy, played by Elvis Presley granddaughter Riley Keough, can sing. New episodes Fridays, Prime Video

No more ‘Saul,’ but here’s ‘Lucky Hank’

No, there’s no more “Better Call Saul,” but Bob Odenkirk, the actor who made its final season both heartbreaking and redeeming (and has consistently been robbed by the Emmys) is back in a new TV series. “Lucky Hank” puts Odenkirk back in his comedy-drama sweet spot as Hank Devereaux, the disenchanted head of the English department at a mediocre Pennsylvania college. Paul Lieberstein of “The Office” is co-showrunner and Mireille Enos plays Hank’s high school vice-principal wife. March 19, AMC/AMC Plus

Kiefer Sutherland goes down a ‘Rabbit Hole’

Speaking of leading men returning to TV, Jack Bauer himself, Canadian actor Kiefer Sutherland (“24,” “Designated Survivor”), has a new series in which he stars as a corporate espionage operative who has the tables turned on him when he’s framed for murder. It promises to get into the fraught topics of digital surveillance, manipulation and disinformation while allowing Sutherland to polish his action hero cred. March 26, Paramount Plus

Donald Glover sets ‘Swarm’ loose

Now that the comedy-drama “Atlanta” has wrapped, multi-hyphenate Donald Glover has a new non-screen role as co-creator with Janine Nabers of “Swarm,” a horror thriller about a young woman who becomes dangerously obsessed with a pop star. The talented Dominique Fishback (“The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,” “The Deuce”) stars as the superfan. If that’s not enough, Malia Obama, daughter of the former president, is one of the writers and Paris Jackson, daughter of Michael Jackson, is in the cast. Said to be inspired by Beyoncé’s Beyhive of fans, “Swarm” has a SXSW premiere March 10. March 17, Prime Video

History of the World: Part II

Sequels and reboots are de rigueur these days, but 42 years must set a record between an original production and its followup. Mel Brooks’ film “The History of the World: Part 1” came out in 1981 and became a comedy classic, spoofing the epic film genre while mining the past for funny bits. The new series comes from the 96-year-old Brooks (who also narrates) alongside Nick Kroll, Wanda Sykes and Ike Barinholtz, and parodies both history and pop culture. Having seen the first episode, I can’t say every sketch slays, but there’s surely something for everyone in the eight-part series. March 6, Disney Star

‘Great Expectations’ for period dramas

It looks to be another banner year for period dramas. The big one this month is the Dickens adaptation “Great Expectations” and I’m cheating a bit here. It’s on Hulu in the U.S. March 26, but its Disney Plus debut has yet to be confirmed. Still, how can you ignore Oscar and Emmy winner Olivia Colman in the role of vengeful Miss Havisham, so fixated on being jilted as a young woman she refuses to take off her wedding dress? Even if our “Great Expectations” go unmet, there’s still the final season of Jane Austen adaptation “Sanditon”; a new take on doomed queen “Marie Antoinette”; and Season 12 of “Call the Midwife” all on PBS. Plus BritBox has “The Confessions of Frannie Langton,” about a former Jamaican slave accused of murdering her white employers in London. March 19, PBS; March 8, BritBox

TikTok’s Bold Glamour filter is so good it might be bad for you. Here’s why experts are concerned,"Sat, 4 Mar 2023 07:30:00 EST",Alessia Passafiume - Staff Reporter,https://www.thestar.com/life/2023/03/04/tiktoks-bold-glamour-filter-is-so-good-it-might-be-bad-for-you-heres-why-experts-are-concerned.html,"As a digital anthropologist, Rahaf Harfoush spends a lot of time online. It’s her job.

But when she opened the TikTok app a few days ago, she noticed something new: Bold Glamour, the latest TikTok filter to go viral, appeared in video after video in her feed.

She first noticed its quality — the filter reshapes faces by carving out the jawline, plumping lips, slimming down the nose and creating a shimmery, smoky eye, sharp cheekbone contour and highlight — and thought the technology behind it was “really good.”

Unlike an earlier generation of filters, this technology won’t glitch, drop or budge when users touch their face, or cover an eye. And unless you’re familiar with the filter and catch the Bold Glamour tag at the bottom of TikTok videos where it’s used, it would be difficult to realize the influencer you follow is using a filter at all.

Then Harfoush began to worry.

What effect could social media filters have on people who use them?

“This is just horrific for young people, for anybody, really,” said Harfoush, who also serves as the executive director of the Red Thread Institute of Digital Culture, a global think tank that focuses on the impact of technology.

Sure, people of every generation had beauty standards imposed on them, but the beauty and celebrity magazines, television shows and movies that defined popular culture for Millennials or Gen Xers were external — something to gaze at, even something to aspire to. Not so with filters.

“Instead of seeing somebody who had a face that didn’t look like yours — and seeing that beauty standard as external — we’re essentially taking those beauty standards and superimposing them on our own faces,” said Harfoush. “We’re then just emphasizing this ‘lack,’ which I think is very damaging to people.”

Harfoush also noted each filter has a “bias” of what its creators think beauty looks like, and which features are worthy of inclusion. Often, there are ethnic stereotypes embedded into them, which emphasize features of Western beauty norms for femininity such as slimmer faces and softer angles, big bright eyes over eyes with fine lines.

What’s also concerning is the homogenization of beauty standards into one, said Harfoush. These filters are available for use across the world, and erase or flatten beauty standards from around the world. “All the filters look the same, so everybody using them is starting to look the same.”

What are TikTok users saying about the Bold Glamour filter?

Reactions to the Bold Glamour filter vary. Some say it shows how far filter technology has come since the days of the unnatural Snapchat dog filter that gave users cartoon dog ears and a long tongue, while others say it’s made them question their own looks in comparison to it.

“I don’t look anything like this,” said one user using the filter. “I don’t think my brain knows how to deal with looking like this one minute, and then this the next,” she said as she revealed her face without the filter on.

The implicit message, Harfoush said, is that users aren’t “good enough” without digital modifications.

In the late 2010s, experts raised concerns about “Snapchat dysmorphia,” a body-image disorder sometimes brought upon users who frequently edited their photos. And according to a study in the American Journal of Cosmetic Surgery, face-altering software can lead to users wanting to undergo facial cosmetic procedures to enhance their appearances.

In a recent report from the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, it was noted that Gen Z is booking cosmetic procedures at higher rates than before, and 75 per cent of surgeons in the U.S. said they saw a spike in clients under 30 in 2022.

“That’s what’s so creepy” about filters, said Harfoush. “When it goes off, it’s reminding you of how much you don’t have.”

How did beauty filter technology get this good?

In a late February update to TikTok’s filter creation tools, Effect House, the platform announced filter creators would have access to generative AI effects like an eyebrow eraser, lip puckering and a smiling effect.

Generative effects use Generative Adversarial Networks to “generate a new human face with superficial characteristics,” Effect House wrote in a user guide about the update. “These generative effects are applied to match the skin and provide a seamless look.”

TikTok isn’t saying whether the Bold Glamour filter was created using this technology, but it is unlike any other filter users have seen to date. Harfoush thinks it’s just the beginning of a new era of digital body modification, and that filters will be increasingly difficult to detect online.

For now, TikTok labels when people are using these types of filters — which is a “good thing” — but that’s not always the case with other social media platforms, like grid posts Instagram. (Instagram Stories that use filters have a label on them telling users which filter is being used.)

When the technology becomes invisible, that’s when more problems begin to arise, Harfoush said. And “it can be really damaging if we don’t start talking about it.”

Blue Jays star Vladimir Guerrero Jr. withdraws from World Baseball Classic due to right knee discomfort,"Sat, 4 Mar 2023 14:20:46 EST",Braydon Holmyard - Toronto Star,https://www.thestar.com/sports/bluejays/2023/03/04/blue-jays-star-vladimir-guerrero-jr-withdraws-from-world-baseball-classic-due-to-right-knee-discomfort.html,"Vladimir Guerrero Jr. was forced to withdraw from the World Baseball Classic as the superstar from the Dominican Republic is experiencing right knee discomfort, the Blue Jays announced Saturday.

Guerrero left in the second inning of Friday’s spring training game against Tampa Bay because of the right knee discomfort.

“Just checking it out, seeing how he is,” Blue Jays manager John Schneider said after the game. “We’ll see how he feels tomorrow. Really just playing it safe at this point and this part of camp.”

According to MLB.com, Guerrero underwent an MRI later that night that revealed no structural damage to the knee, though there is some minor inflammation that the Blue Jays want to treat carefully.

Guerrero had an RBI single during the first inning in his lone at-bat. He went awkwardly into second base later in the inning.

The slugger hit .274 with 32 homers and 97 RBIs in 160 games last year and was expected to star on a stacked Dominican Republic roster at the World Baseball Classic.

He was scheduled to leave after Sunday’s game to join the team and prepare for the first game on March 11 against Venezuela.
