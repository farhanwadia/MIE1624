Unlike Bag of Words representations, word embeddings are able to capture the semantic relationships between words and can represent the meaning of a word based on its context.\n",

The basic idea behind word2vec is to train a neural network to predict the context of a word given its surrounding words. The context of a word refers to the words that appear in its vicinity, such as the words that come before and after it in a sentence or paragraph.\n",

The input layer corresponds to the words in the vocabulary, and each word is represented by an embedding vector whose dimension can be a user-defined parameter. The output layer consists of a set of softmax nodes, each representing a word in the vocabulary. The objective of the network is to predict the probability distribution of the words in the vocabulary given the input word.\n",
        "\n",
        "During training, the network is fed with pairs of words and their context words, and the objective is to minimize the cross-entropy loss between the predicted probability distribution and the actual context words. The weights of the hidden layer are then used as the word embeddings for the corresponding words in the vocabulary.\n",
