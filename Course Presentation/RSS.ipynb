Lavrov, on the sidelines of a Group of 20 meeting, the first one-on-one meeting between the two top diplomats since Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than a year ago.\\n\\nThe unexpected encounter came as the Russian government used the meeting of G20 foreign ministers in New Delhi, the Indian capital, accused Western nations of “blackmail and threats.”\\n\\nIn their meeting, Mr. Blinken made three points to Mr. Lavrov, a senior State Department official told reporters: the United States would continue to support Ukraine in its defense against Russia “for as long as it takes”; Russia should rejoin the New START nuclear arms control treaty from which it recently withdrew and abide by the terms; and that Russia should release Paul Whelan, an American citizen whom the U.S. says is wrongfully imprisoned.\\n\\nThe official did not say who initiated the encounter between the two diplomats.\\n\\nEarlier on Thursday, Mr. Blinken used the G20 meeting in to call on Russia to withdraw from Ukraine for the sake of international peace and stability.\\n\\nAnd he held one-on-one talks with top diplomats from the G20 nations, with the aim of rallying greater support for Ukraine as it tries to repel an onslaught of Russian troops and braces for a potential new Russian offensive this spring.\\n\\n“We must continue to call on Russia to end its war of aggression and withdraw from Ukraine for the sake of international peace and economic stability,” Mr. Blinken said in a closed-door group meeting in the morning, according to a text of his remarks released to reporters by the State Department. “Unfortunately, this meeting has again been marred by Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified war against Ukraine,” he added.\\n\\nMr. Blinken said Wednesday before flying from Uzbekistan to India that he had no plans to meet with Sergey V. Lavrov, the foreign minister of Russia, or Qin Gang, the foreign minister of China. Mr. Blinken and Mr. Lavrov have avoided direct confrontation since the war began in February last year.\\n\\nFollowing a meeting between Mr. Lavrov and Chinese counterpart Mr. Qin on the sidelines, the Russian foreign ministry issued a strongly worded statement saying Western nations were meddling in “the internal affairs of other countries, to impose unilateral approaches through blackmail and threats, and to oppose the democratization of international relations.”\\n\\nEarlier on Thursday, Russian state media played down the chances of a meeting between Mr. Blinken and Mr. Lavrov. The two men “sat far apart” from each other at the first plenary session of the G20 meeting, Russian state media reported. A spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, said that a meeting between the two would not take place because “destruction is part of the logic of U.S. foreign policy in general,” the state-run Tass news agency reported.\\n\\nMr. Lavrov said the meeting would not end in the customary joint communiqué due to disagreements on the war in Ukraine.\\n\\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi of India said in an opening video address to the diplomats that, while he understood that discussions “are affected by the geopolitical tensions of the day” — a clear reference to the Ukraine war — he hoped they would keep the focus on global crises affecting the many developing nations of the world. He cited economic issues, climate change and the pandemic.\\n\\nBut the war in Ukraine nevertheless dominated the morning group session and other parts of the meeting. Mr. Blinken met one-on-one with Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, the Indian foreign minister, and the two “discussed how to mitigate the global impacts of Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine” and “the United States and India’s cooperation in the Indo-Pacific,” the State Department said in a readout. The second phrase is a reference to strategic efforts in Asia, including military coordination, to counter China.\\n\\nOn Wednesday in Uzbekistan, his second stop on a two-day trip to Central Asia, Mr. Blinken said that the Biden administration saw “zero evidence” that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was prepared to engage in serious peace talks.\\n\\nMujib Mashal contributed reporting.',\n",

Many of its inmates were freed when Ukraine’s forces liberated the city more than three months ago.\\n\\nBut one prominent prisoner is still missing: the city’s former mayor, Ihor Kolykhaev.\\n\\nThe mayor, who refused to flee and for a while remained at his post after Russian forces swept into Kherson, was arrested in June and put in solitary confinement. In the fall, as Ukrainian forces advanced on the city, Mr. Kolykhaev’s jailers moved him deeper inside Russian-held territory, according to witnesses.\\n\\nHe has not been heard from since.\\n\\nThe disappearance has deepened questions swirling around Mr. Kolykhaev and the role he tried to play. Though he refused to acknowledge the Russians’ authority or swear fealty to them, he remained at his desk, working to keep the lights on and the buses running. The decision helped to ensure a livable city but also smoothed the way for Russian forces to create an occupation government.',\n",

He faces charges of manslaughter through neglect and of disrupting the safety of public transport, amid news reports in Greece that he had directed the two trains onto their collision course.\\n\\nThe Greek health minister, Thanos Plevris, said that many of the passengers were young people or college students who had possibly been taking advantage of a three-day holiday weekend to celebrate carnival, the period of revelry just before Lent. Thessaloniki, the train’s destination, is Greece’s second-largest city, and it is known as a university city hosting tens of thousands of students.\\n\\nImage Vaios Vlachos and Daphne Brella. He was still missing as of Wednesday night, and she was in an intensive care unit. Credit... Evangelos Vlachos\\n\\nOn Wednesday night, Georgios Smirnopoulos, a taxi driver in Thessaloniki, drove by Aristotle University, the largest in Greece, and pointed at it, wondering if any of the crash victims had studied there.\\n\\n“It was a lot of students, of young people,” he said. “Today is a tragic day.”\\n\\nAnastasia Papaggeli, 18, a student of agriculture at Aristotle University, is among those missing after the crash. Her sister, Urania, 20, said that Anastasia had gone to the city of Patras, near Athens, for carnival celebrations, where she dressed up as an elf.\\n\\nAnastasia called Urania at about 11 p.m. on Tuesday to say that she was fine and making her way back to Thessaloniki on a night train. A couple of hours later, Urania read the news about the deadly crash. She called her sister, who had been traveling on the train’s third carriage, but there was no answer.',\n",

We can’t forget that, basically, these people are seeking to improve their lot, as we would all do.”\\n\\nAs the Supreme Court weighs the fate of the treaty, migrants continue to flow through the Roxham Road crossing, intensifying demands that it be closed.\\n\\nBut simply shutting it down, experts said, would likely push migrants to try to cross into Canada through more dangerous points along the country’s 5,500-mile border with the United States.\\n\\n“It’s very unclear,’’ said Laura Macdonald, a political scientist at Carleton University, “how you would keep out tens of thousands of asylum claimants who think they have the right to cross the border from doing so.’’\\n\\nNasuna Stuart-Ulin contributed reporting from Saint-Bernard-de-Lacolle.',\n",

He said it would involve “balanced, reciprocal and responsible” relations, respectful of African needs at a time of intense competition for influence and profit across the continent from Russia and China.\\n\\n“Macron wants to salvage what he can,” said Thierry Vircoulon, a research associate at the French Institute of International Relations. “His first term was a failure, both in terms of the war on terrorism and the attempt to maintain French influence.”\\n\\nAn era is coming to an end.

In the Democratic primary, he lost only one of the city’s five boroughs: Manhattan, the wealthiest.\\n\\nIn New York State last year, Republican candidates in the midterms focused on crime and did much better than usual. Democratic candidates often tried to change the subject. “I think those who stated, ‘Don’t talk about crime,’ it was an insult to Black and brown communities where a lot of this crime was playing out,” Adams said after the election. Nancy Pelosi told The Times’s Maureen Dowd that Democrats might have maintained control of the House of Representatives if the party’s candidates in New York had taken crime more seriously.\\n\\nRepublicans also fared well last year in Oregon, where the largest city — Portland — has become a symbol of post-pandemic disorder.

That will depend on whether the Democratic Unionists can be coaxed back into a power-sharing arrangement with the Irish nationalist party, Sinn Fein.\\n\\nUnderstand the Deal Over the Northern Ireland Protocol Card 1 of 6 Healing a Brexit wound. Britain and the European Union struck a landmark agreement to end a festering dispute over post-Brexit trade rules known as the Northern Ireland Protocol, potentially resolving one of the most poisonous legacies of Britain’s exit from Europe’s trade bloc in 2020. Here’s what to know about the dispute and the renegotiated agreement: What is at issue? Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom, but it shares a land border with Ireland, an E.U. member. Negotiators have struggled to find a way to allow goods to move smoothly between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom, without threatening the open border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? The original protocol, signed in 2020, effectively left Northern Ireland half inside the European system and half inside the British one. The Irish border remained open, but that meant that to enforce differing customs rules, goods had to be checked when they crossed between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. Why was this a problem? The system of customs checks effectively created a trade border inside of Britain, down the Irish Sea. Some British companies stopped shipping goods to Northern Ireland, blaming the added paperwork. The situation enraged some Conservative Party lawmakers and many of Northern Ireland’s unionists — the largely Protestant part of the territory that wants to remain in Britain. How does the new deal address this? The latest agreement, called the Windsor Framework, looks to smooth over some of the original protocol’s contradictions. One way is by creating a “green lane” with little bureaucracy for goods traveling from Britain to Northern Ireland that are destined to stay there. Goods headed on to Ireland will use a “red lane,” with full checks. What is at stake? Some in Brussels have spoken of a threat to the integrity of the E.U.’s single economic market, while some in London and Belfast have warned of a threat to the coherence of the United Kingdom. There are also concerns about the fragility of peace in Northern Ireland, a region where decades of sectarian violence left thousands dead.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSome unionists expressed anger at what they said was the government’s improper use of King Charles III, who is supposed to be above politics, to sell the deal. It is called the Windsor Framework, which happens to be the king’s family name. It was sealed at a hotel in Windsor, west of London, where the king has a castle. And Charles welcomed one of the signatories, Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, for tea shortly after she and Mr. Sunak announced the deal.\\n\\nStill, the generally positive reaction to the agreement, analysts said, is a tribute to Mr. Sunak’s negotiating skills. On the issues that matter to the Brexiteers, like the jurisdiction of European Union law over Northern Ireland, he extracted significant concessions from Brussels. Under the terms of the deal, the territory’s elected assembly will have a lever to reject the imposition of new E.U. laws.\\n\\nMr. Sunak was able to obtain such compromises, they said, because his counterparts in Brussels viewed him as a good-faith negotiator, who earnestly sought a deal to reset relations between London and Brussels.\\n\\nThat is a stark contrast to his predecessors, Liz Truss and Boris Johnson. Mr. Johnson is viewed with suspicion in many European capitals as the man who reneged on his own Northern Ireland trade deal with Brussels. As foreign secretary, Ms. Truss proposed legislation — which Mr. Sunak has now scrapped — that would unilaterally discard parts of that agreement.\\n\\n“Sunak’s agreement significantly improves upon the deal Johnson did,” said Mujtaba Rahman, a former European Commission official who is now an analyst at the political risk consultancy, Eurasia Group. “He’s not instrumentalizing Northern Ireland in the way that Johnson and Truss did for their own domestic political purposes.”\\n\\nBeyond the fine print in the deal, which covers issues like the customs paperwork needed to mail packages, Mr. Sunak also benefited from the passage of time. Nearly seven years after the referendum that set Brexit in motion, the country has grown weary of ceaseless debates about it.'}"
